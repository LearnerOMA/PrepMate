In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience. Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it. In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit. We think people are gonna use this a lot and love it.”Replying to his post, Altman added: “So we think it's better to let people have real, long conversations with it, but that means we have to stagger people in rather than have everyone hit it hard at the same time. Hope that makes sense and look forward to seeing your feedback!”Altman praises team working on AI modelsLater, Altman also shared a separate post on X to praise the OpenAI team’s achievements, particularly the company’s advancements. In this post, he wrote: “Very proud of the OpenAI team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades. Thought that was the thing I'd always be most proud of in life. Turns out I am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own.”Commenting on this post, Altman also noted: “I realize I am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best.”Last week, OpenAI announced the GPT-4.5 model, the final version that doesn’t use chain-of-thought prompting—a technique that simulates human reasoning by breaking tasks into steps.","Hope that makes sense and look forward to seeing your feedback!”Altman praises team working on AI modelsLater, Altman also shared a separate post on X to praise the OpenAI team’s achievements, particularly the company’s advancements.

latest, Qualcomm Ceo Cristiano Amon Repeats His 'Iphone Prediction' For The Year 2027 ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/qualcomm-ceo-cristiano-amon-repeats-his-iphone-prediction-for-the-year-2027/articleshow/118761037.cms," Mar 06, 2025, 17:04 (IST)","Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon is betting big on the company's latest high-end modem, X85. In an interview with CNBC, Amon claimed that the company's latest X85 modem will significantly outperform Apple's recently introduced C1 modem, creating a substantial performance gap between premium Android devices and iPhones. Announced recently, Qualcomm's high-end X85 modem integrates advanced AI capabilities, enhancing its ability to handle weaker signals and extend performance range, according to Amon. Qualcomm CEO added, ""It’s the first modem with so much AI."" Apple recently entered the smartphone modem race with Apple C1, its first self-designed modem. Apple C1 modem made its debut in Apple's latest addition in iPhone 16 series, iPhone 16e. For years, Apple has sourced modems from Qualcomm, the world's biggest supplier of the chips. Qualcomm chips also power Android gadgets and Windows laptops.Qualcomm CEO on iPhonesWhile talking about how X85 modem will give Android phones an edge over iPhones, Qualcomm CEO also reiterated his earlier 'iPhone prediction' that he expects Qualcomm will not supply Apple with modems in 2027. At the same time, Amon expressed confidence in Qualcomm's edge. “If modem is relevant there’s always a place for Qualcomm technology,” Amon said. He added, “In the age of AI, modems are going to be more important than they have ever been. And I think that’s going to drive consumer preference about do they want the best possible modem in the computer that’s in their hand all the time.” How Apple's entry in modem race goes back to 2019Modems, essential for connecting smartphones to mobile networks, have been a core strength of Qualcomm. The company has been a leading global supplier of modems for Apple's iPhones. However, in July 2019, Apple and Intel signed an agreement for Apple to acquire the majority of Intel’s smartphone modem business. Approximately 2,200 Intel employees join Apple, along with intellectual property, equipment and leases. Apple's acquisition of Intel's modem division made it clear that the company wants to go its own way and follow the same strategy as it has for smartphone processors. The iPhone 16e, which runs on the same A18 processor chip as the rest of other phones in the iPhone 16 lineup, has the best battery life of any of its 6.1-inch phones thanks to the C1 system, Apple's Kaiann Drance, vice president of iPhone product marketing, told Reuters. The iPhone 16e also has Apple's latest artificial intelligence (AI) features.One of the ways Apple hopes that the C1 will set its iPhones apart is by tightly integrating it with its A-series processor chips. Giving an example Arun Mathias, vice president for wireless software at Apple, told the news agency that if an iPhone encounters congested data networks, the phone's processor can signal to the modem which traffic is the most time sensitive and put it ahead of other data transfers, making the phone feel more responsive to the user's needs.","“If modem is relevant there’s always a place for Qualcomm technology,” Amon said.

In a post shared on social media platform X (earlier Twitter), Altman announced that GPT-4.5 is expected to roll out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. However, he noted that the update will be a staggered rollout over several days to manage high demand and ensure a smooth user experience. Altman also explained that launching with a low rate limit would restrict usage and prevent users from having meaningful interactions with the new model. The staggered release will allow users to have longer conversations with GPT-4.5, even if it means some subscribers will have to wait a bit longer to access it. In his X announcement, Altman wrote: “We are likely going to roll out GPT-4.5 to the plus tier over a few days. There is no perfect way to do this; we wanted to do it for everyone tomorrow, but it would have meant we had to launch with a very low rate limit. We think people are gonna use this a lot and love it.”Replying to his post, Altman added: “So we think it's better to let people have real, long conversations with it, but that means we have to stagger people in rather than have everyone hit it hard at the same time. Hope that makes sense and look forward to seeing your feedback!”Altman praises team working on AI modelsLater, Altman also shared a separate post on X to praise the OpenAI team’s achievements, particularly the company’s advancements. In this post, he wrote: “Very proud of the OpenAI team for what is perhaps the most impressive scientific/technical breakthrough of recent decades. Thought that was the thing I'd always be most proud of in life. Turns out I am now more proud of a preemie baby for learning how to eat on his own.”Commenting on this post, Altman also noted: “I realize I am getting neurochemically hacked here but idc, it's the best.”Last week, OpenAI announced the GPT-4.5 model, the final version that doesn’t use chain-of-thought prompting—a technique that simulates human reasoning by breaking tasks into steps.","Hope that makes sense and look forward to seeing your feedback!”Altman praises team working on AI modelsLater, Altman also shared a separate post on X to praise the OpenAI team’s achievements, particularly the company’s advancements.

latest, Qualcomm Ceo Cristiano Amon Repeats His 'Iphone Prediction' For The Year 2027 ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/qualcomm-ceo-cristiano-amon-repeats-his-iphone-prediction-for-the-year-2027/articleshow/118761037.cms," Mar 06, 2025, 17:04 (IST)","Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon is betting big on the company's latest high-end modem, X85. In an interview with CNBC, Amon claimed that the company's latest X85 modem will significantly outperform Apple's recently introduced C1 modem, creating a substantial performance gap between premium Android devices and iPhones. Announced recently, Qualcomm's high-end X85 modem integrates advanced AI capabilities, enhancing its ability to handle weaker signals and extend performance range, according to Amon. Qualcomm CEO added, ""It’s the first modem with so much AI."" Apple recently entered the smartphone modem race with Apple C1, its first self-designed modem. Apple C1 modem made its debut in Apple's latest addition in iPhone 16 series, iPhone 16e. For years, Apple has sourced modems from Qualcomm, the world's biggest supplier of the chips. Qualcomm chips also power Android gadgets and Windows laptops.Qualcomm CEO on iPhonesWhile talking about how X85 modem will give Android phones an edge over iPhones, Qualcomm CEO also reiterated his earlier 'iPhone prediction' that he expects Qualcomm will not supply Apple with modems in 2027. At the same time, Amon expressed confidence in Qualcomm's edge. “If modem is relevant there’s always a place for Qualcomm technology,” Amon said. He added, “In the age of AI, modems are going to be more important than they have ever been. And I think that’s going to drive consumer preference about do they want the best possible modem in the computer that’s in their hand all the time.” How Apple's entry in modem race goes back to 2019Modems, essential for connecting smartphones to mobile networks, have been a core strength of Qualcomm. The company has been a leading global supplier of modems for Apple's iPhones. However, in July 2019, Apple and Intel signed an agreement for Apple to acquire the majority of Intel’s smartphone modem business. Approximately 2,200 Intel employees join Apple, along with intellectual property, equipment and leases. Apple's acquisition of Intel's modem division made it clear that the company wants to go its own way and follow the same strategy as it has for smartphone processors. The iPhone 16e, which runs on the same A18 processor chip as the rest of other phones in the iPhone 16 lineup, has the best battery life of any of its 6.1-inch phones thanks to the C1 system, Apple's Kaiann Drance, vice president of iPhone product marketing, told Reuters. The iPhone 16e also has Apple's latest artificial intelligence (AI) features.One of the ways Apple hopes that the C1 will set its iPhones apart is by tightly integrating it with its A-series processor chips. Giving an example Arun Mathias, vice president for wireless software at Apple, told the news agency that if an iPhone encounters congested data networks, the phone's processor can signal to the modem which traffic is the most time sensitive and put it ahead of other data transfers, making the phone feel more responsive to the user's needs.","“If modem is relevant there’s always a place for Qualcomm technology,” Amon said.

As expected, they were stopped by a big contingent of Delhi Police. The house had been barricaded.""For months, BJP leaders have been shouting that the Delhi chief minister's residence has a gold toilet, a swimming pool and a mini bar. I brought the media here along with our minister.

The bungalow had been offered last year to chief minister Atishi but was reclaimed by PWD on Jan 6, which, according to Delhi Police, had asked for police deployment outside the house, anticipating a law-and-order problem. The PWD is currently in possession of the bungalow and has offered two other bungalows to Atishi.After being stopped by the cops, both AAP functionaries sat on a dharna outside the residence for a few minutes. Later, they left for Prime Minister Narendar Modi's residence at 7 Lok Kalyan Marg.On the way, they were intercepted by Delhi Police at the Teen Murti roundabout, which is close to the PM's residence.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

But he thinks this may not be enough for him to be successful in India. And among the reasons include two of India's biggest Business Groups in the auto segment -- Tata Group and Mahindra Group. Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

But he thinks this may not be enough for him to be successful in India. And among the reasons include two of India's biggest Business Groups in the auto segment -- Tata Group and Mahindra Group. Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech. He highlighted how these communities went from being the nation's ""last villages"" to becoming its ""first villages."" There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

But he thinks this may not be enough for him to be successful in India. And among the reasons include two of India's biggest Business Groups in the auto segment -- Tata Group and Mahindra Group. Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech. He highlighted how these communities went from being the nation's ""last villages"" to becoming its ""first villages."" There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility.

""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

But he thinks this may not be enough for him to be successful in India. And among the reasons include two of India's biggest Business Groups in the auto segment -- Tata Group and Mahindra Group. Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country. According to a report in news agency Reuters, citing registration papers, Tesla has signed a lease deal to open its showroom in Mumbai. The showroom is reported to be opened in the Maker Maxity building in the business and retail hub of Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) near Mumbai airport.Tesla India entry and PM Narendra Modi's US visitReports about Tesla's India entry started just days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Tesla CEO Elon Musk in the United States.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech. He highlighted how these communities went from being the nation's ""last villages"" to becoming its ""first villages."" There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech. He highlighted how these communities went from being the nation's ""last villages"" to becoming its ""first villages."" There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Judge Pablo Zuniga of the Federal Regional Court overturned a previous ruling and reinstated an injunction from Brazil's antitrust authority, CADE. The Administrative Council for Economic Defense or CADE is an independent agency reporting to Brazil's Ministry of Justice.Valor International reports that Zuniga justified the decision by noting that ""Apple has already complied with similar obligations in other countries without demonstrating significant impact or irreparable harm to its economic model.""What is case against Apple in Brazil all aboutThe case originated from a 2022 complaint by Latin American e-commerce company Mercado Livre, which accused Apple of abusing its dominant market position by forcing developers to use Apple's payment system for digital goods and services.Apple plans to appeal the decision, stating: ""We are concerned that the interim measures proposed by CADE would undermine the privacy and security of our users."" The company has used similar security and privacy arguments when fighting against app sideloading in other regions.Brazil's antitrust investigation follows similar regulatory action in the European Union, where Apple was forced to allow alternative app stores under the Digital Markets Act. Apple implemented these changes for EU users with iOS 17.4, creating a precedent that Judge Zuniga referenced in his ruling.The 90-day Deadline for AppleThe judge extended the implementation timeline from CADE's original 20-day requirement to 90 days, acknowledging that ""structural changes in operating systems require some planning and technical development.""If the ruling stands, Brazil would become the second major market after the EU where Apple must open its tightly controlled iOS ecosystem to alternative app distribution methods, potentially setting a precedent for similar actions in other countries.","Judge Pablo Zuniga of the Federal Regional Court overturned a previous ruling and reinstated an injunction from Brazil's antitrust authority, CADE.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskky clarified multiple times that he would not wear a suit until the Russia-Ukraine war comes to an end. His sartorial choice became a major issue during his White House visit before it turned into a full-blown war of words resulting in an unexpected showdown -- as he was asked why he was not wearing a suit. Illia Ponomarenko, a Ukrainian journalist has now told POLITICO that though Zelenskyy's black outfit was seen as casual wear by most Americans, it was not. It was much like his olive-green combat outfit, part of a culture of people who are involved in the war. Zelenskyy's clothes send an anti-elitist messagelllia Ponomarenko said Zelenskyy's clothes send a soft and anti-elitist message. ""When he meets with prominent figures and power brokers, his clothes are basically asking, what are you about? Are you about the business of saving lives, or are you about fancy protocols? Even when he meets with kings, he dresses in a way that represents the average Ukrainian involved in this war effort. So it’s a message to say, 'I’ve come to the corners of power as a representative of my humble people',"" he said. Zelenskyy prefers clothes from M-TAC brandThe journalist said that Zeelenskyy prefers to wear clothes from Ukrainian brands like M-TAC which produces clothes that could also be considered casual. ""But some of these clothes are also the things you'd wear in war zones. These are the same clothes you might wear with body armor and a military combat jacket. When I was working as a war reporter, I had a sweater that was pretty close to what Zelenskyy wore during that meeting,"" he said adding that the black outfit was something that could have been easily worn by someone in the military. Ukrainian trident most importantThe most important part of Zelenskyy's outfit that day was the Ukrainian trident which is one of the key national symbols. Ukrainian designer Elvira Gasanova earlier said the trident set him apart as he's a wartime leader who does not need suits. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Zelenskyy has not deviated from his olive and black T-shirts, sweatshirts that he teas with cargo trousers.","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskky clarified multiple times that he would not wear a suit until the Russia-Ukraine war comes to an end.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan.

The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion.

For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan.

The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

But he thinks this may not be enough for him to be successful in India. And among the reasons include two of India's biggest Business Groups in the auto segment -- Tata Group and Mahindra Group. Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech. He highlighted how these communities went from being the nation's ""last villages"" to becoming its ""first villages."" There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

But he thinks this may not be enough for him to be successful in India. And among the reasons include two of India's biggest Business Groups in the auto segment -- Tata Group and Mahindra Group. Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech. He highlighted how these communities went from being the nation's ""last villages"" to becoming its ""first villages."" There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Ashley's version of the storyAshley made the claim on social media and said she had to do this because tabloid media already got to know that Elon Musk is the father of her child. Then she sued Elon Musk seeking sole custody of the child. In her lawsuit, she attached screenshots of her chats with someone whose name she saved on her phone as 'EM'. EM asked her about her wellbeing after the childbirth and also said he wanted to 'knock her up again'. In May 2023, Ashley and his then-boss Seth Dillon, the CEO of Babylon Bee, a satire website, went to meet Elon Musk at the Twitter (now X) headquarters in San Francisco for an interview.

Trump has also proposed annexing the country as the 51st state, is “against the national interest of Canada,” the petitioners claim.“He has used his wealth and power to influence our elections,” the petition claims. “He has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty.” Responding to the news about the petition, shared by a Twitter user, Elon Musk wrote: “Canada is not a real country.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk, however, later deleted the post. It is not certain why he deleted the post, considering he has been quite vocal about his opinion on a range of issues even if it is opposed by many.

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk’s previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk’s stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‘want to kill me’During Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk’s actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk’s gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What’s relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you’re not invading Poland, maybe you’re not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don’t just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk’s leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk’s remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany’s history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany’s dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk’s alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan’s podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility. Whether this controversy will fade or escalate further will likely depend on Musk’s future actions and public responses.Also read | Airtel recharge plans | Jio recharge plans | BSNL recharge plans","What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.

Elon Musk has often warned about declining populations in several Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea.

In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, “Singapore will go extinct in some time.” Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates. ""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates,"" wrote Vembu.In another post, Vembu made a similar observation about San Fancisco. He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks.

What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization.

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk’s previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk’s stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‘want to kill me’During Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk’s actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk’s gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What’s relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you’re not invading Poland, maybe you’re not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don’t just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk’s leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk’s remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany’s history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany’s dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk’s alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan’s podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility.

Elon Musk has often warned about declining populations in several Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Elon Musk even went on to say that Singapore is particularly at risk due to its falling birth rate and is almost on the verge of extinction. In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, “Singapore will go extinct in some time.” Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates. ""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates,"" wrote Vembu.In another post, Vembu made a similar observation about San Fancisco. He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks.

What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization.

Alongside co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, she played a crucial role in shaping Trump’s 2024 presidential bid. While keeping Trump strictly on-script was often a challenge, Wiles successfully minimised leaks, designed an effective outreach strategy to Latino and Black voters, and helped secure a decisive victory.Earlier in January, the New York Times reported that Musk was set to receive a West Wing office in close proximity to Donald Trump and had already been issued a White House email. However, a subsequent report dismissed the claim, crediting the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles for blocking the move. The Times further reported that Wiles, known as the ""Ice Maiden"" for her cold and strategic demeanor, had blocked Musk from gaining access to the West Wing.Even when Trump himself was asked whether Musk would be given office space in the West Wing. ""No,"" Trump had said.Political analyst Dominic Michael Tripi posted on X that Susie Wiles had reportedly restricted Elon Musk’s direct access to the president, stating, “President Donald Trump’s Chief of Staff Susie Wiles has reportedly limited Elon Musk’s direct access to the President.” Musk responded by dismissing the claim with two laughing emojis.Wiles began her political career on Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential campaign and has since worked with moderate Republicans. Over the years, she has worked alongside several moderate Republican figures, including Jack Kemp, a staunch free-trade advocate, and Tillie Fowler, a congresswoman known for moderate positions on issues like gun control.","Alongside co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita, she played a crucial role in shaping Trump’s 2024 presidential bid.

Addressing the open BRICS plenary session, Modi made 5 suggestions to further intensify intra-BRICS cooperation including the creation of a BRICS space exploration consortium.He was speaking hours before India’s moon mission, Chandrayaan-3, successfully landed on the moon.  While seeking timelines for UNSC reforms, Modi also called for reform of multilateral financial institutions, WTO and urged BRICS to send a global message of unity and not polarisation  On BRICS expansion, the issue that dominated the summit agenda, government sources said India took the lead in forging consensus on membership criteria and selection of new members. India’s efforts are apparently guided by its objective to incorporate strategic partners like Egypt and Saudi Arabia as new members.  “India fully supports the expansion of the BRICS membership. And welcomes moving forward with consensus in this,” said the PM, adding that BRICS will be breaking barriers, revitalising economies, inspiring innovation, creating opportunities, and shaping the future.  South Africa said after the second day of the summit that the leaders agreed to a document which “set out guidelines and principles, processes for considering countries that wish to become members of BRICS”. With many developing countries looking at BRICS with renewed hope at a time of great global uncertainty, 23 countries have formally approached the grouping for membership. In his address, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for speeding up the expansion process saying more members will make global governance more just and equitable. India, however, wanted BRICS to first finalise the criteria and guiding principles for extending membership, something that the summit focused on. A formal announcement on expansion guidelines is expected on Thursday. Modi also lauded South Africa’s focus on the Global South at the summit. “We have also proposed to give permanent membership of G-20 to the African Union. I am sure all the BRICS partners are also together in the G20. And all will support our proposal. Giving special place to all these efforts in BRICS will increase the self-confidence of the countries of the Global South,” he said.  Apart from BRICS space consortium, Modi also proposed undertaking skill mapping, promoting mobility among BRICS countries and joint efforts for protection of Big Cats under International Big Cat Alliance. He also proposed establishing a repository of traditional medicine among BRICS countries.  The PM said public service delivery is being revolutionized through in India through Digital Public Infrastructure and offered the same to BRICS countries. “Diversity is a great strength of India. The solution to any problem in India comes out at the test of this diversity. That's why these solutions can be easily implemented in any corner of the world,” said Modi.","India’s efforts are apparently guided by its objective to incorporate strategic partners like Egypt and Saudi Arabia as new members.

At least three judges had earlier refused to head the commission: a reluctance which was linked to their wariness over the perception that the inquiry was politically motivated. A senior law ministry official said legally speaking, operationalization of the model code of conduct should not hinder the setting up of the commission should they find a retired judge to head it. “The decision to set up the inquiry commission was taken by the Union Cabinet much before the notification of the general elections, hence there is no legal bar on constituting one,” said the official. However, with the poll schedule in place, chances of judges stepping forward may diminish because the appointment of the panel could be seen even more through the prism of politics. In the last two months, the government has failed to convince any retired Supreme Court judge or a retired chief justice of any high court to head the commission, said sources in the law ministry. The BJP was relishing the discomfiture of the government. Leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley said the UPA government’s failure to find a judge showed that the “arrogant” government was facing “moral isolation”. “One after another retired judges of the Supreme Court were approached to head the Commission. They declined to lend themselves for this politically motivated exercise. Thereafter, retired chief justices of high courts were also approached. Apparently, they also made it clear that they were not available for such exercise. The government has been morally isolated with nobody is willing to cooperate in its colourable exercise of power”. The decision to set up the commission was taken the Union cabinet on December 26 to probe the role of Modi who, according to a web portal, had allegedly given instructions to state police to put a young woman under surveillance. The surveillance of the woman was carried out by the state police in 2009, allegedly under the dictates of the political leadership. An alleged phone conversation of the then junior Gujarat home minister Amit Shah asking police officers to put the woman under surveillance for security reasons was released by a web portal. Though, the woman’s father later claimed he had requested the Gujarat CM to put his daughter under surveillance. Jaitley also stressed the refusal of noted Jurist Fali S Nariman as well as retired SC judge Justice K T Thomas to be part of the Lokpal search committee, to say that this had validated the worry that government had usurped the powers of the committee for selecting the ombussman. “They ( Nariman and Justice Thomas) believe that the process being undertaken is not intended to select the best man for the job. It is now clear that the institution of Lokpal is being damaged even prior to its creation. When eminent and independent persons of repute are refusing to associate with the search and selection exercise while suspecting the motives of the government, its moral isolation is complete”.",The government has been morally isolated with nobody is willing to cooperate in its colourable exercise of power”.

The letter describes the community as “microscopic” and “minuscule” that needs this additional protection. It further draws the PM’s attention to the Anglo-Indians’ significant contributions to the country’s progress, especially in the field of education by way of establishing schools. “We need to be represented so that our voices are heard and our concerns be taken into account,” the letter says.The letter says that the only community the Constitution mentions is that of Anglo-Indians.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan.

The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion.

For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record.

He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US. He’s super smart, no question about it. He’s a maverick, doing spacecraft and all that. He’s done amazing work, so I don’t want to take anything from him. But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore.

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk’s previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk’s stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‘want to kill me’During Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk’s actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk’s gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What’s relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you’re not invading Poland, maybe you’re not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don’t just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk’s leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk’s remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany’s history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany’s dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk’s alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan’s podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility. Whether this controversy will fade or escalate further will likely depend on Musk’s future actions and public responses.Also read | Airtel recharge plans | Jio recharge plans | BSNL recharge plans","What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.

Elon Musk even went on to say that Singapore is particularly at risk due to its falling birth rate and is almost on the verge of extinction. In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, “Singapore will go extinct in some time.” Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates. ""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates,"" wrote Vembu.In another post, Vembu made a similar observation about San Fancisco. He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks. It felt empty, particularly going from my Tenkasi village,"" wrote Vembu.

Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates.Japan suffered from this same problem in the 1980s and 90s. What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization. We need fresh thinking.","""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment.

The duo used 'Grok Unhinged Mode' In the podcast, Elon Musk asks: ""what is there in Fort Knox?"" They follow with another similar question: ""Do you think all the Gold is there in Fort Knox?"" In answer, the AI chatbot is seen kinda evading the sensitive question. As to those unaware what Fort Knox is? Fort Knox is the most famous repository for Gold in the US. Other than Fort Know, vast quantities of Gold are also reported to be held at mints in West Point, Denver and at the Federal Reserve vault in New York.Coming to the latest on Grok, Elon Musk's xAI recently unveiled an enhanced version of its Grok-3 chatbot. This launch comes shortly after OpenAI rejected Elon Musk's $97.4 billion offer to acquire its nonprofit division. During a livestream, xAI claimed that Grok-3 surpasses OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini, DeepSeek’s V3, and Anthropic’s Claude across various math, science, and coding benchmarks. Musk highlighted that Grok-3 boasts over ten times the computational power of its predecessor, with pre-training finalized in early January.These performance claims, yet to be independently verified, heat up the rivalry between xAI and OpenAI. Grok-3 is accessible to X Premium+ subscribers for $22 per month.","They follow with another similar question: ""Do you think all the Gold is there in Fort Knox?""

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk’s previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk’s stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‘want to kill me’During Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk’s actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk’s gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What’s relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you’re not invading Poland, maybe you’re not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don’t just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk’s leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk’s remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany’s history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany’s dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk’s alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan’s podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility. Whether this controversy will fade or escalate further will likely depend on Musk’s future actions and public responses.Also read | Airtel recharge plans | Jio recharge plans | BSNL recharge plans","What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.

On Saturday, several protesters were arrested outside a Tesla dealership in New York City, with some chanting, “We need clean air, not another billionaire,” according to the New York Post.Earlier in the week, around 350 demonstrators gathered outside a Tesla dealership in Portland, Oregon, chanting, “Elon Musk has got to go.” Last week, protests erupted at more than 50 Tesla stores across the US, with some demonstrations extending internationally to cities like Barcelona, London, and Lisbon.Many of these protests appear to be coordinated through the Tesla Takedown website, which encourages participants to “sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines.” The site lists the Troublemakers and Disruption Project organizations as sponsors—two groups mentioned in Musk’s recent post.","In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Musk stated, “An investigation has found 5 ActBlue-funded groups responsible for Tesla “protests”: Troublemakers, Disruption Project, Rise & Resist, Indivisible Project and Democratic Socialists of America.” He further named the funders of the groups that included George Soros, Reid Hoffman, Herbert Sandler, Patricia Bauman, and Leah Hunt-Hendrix. ActBlue is currently under investigation for allowing foreign and illegal donations in criminal violation of campaign finance regulations."

Elon Musk has often warned about declining populations in several Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Elon Musk even went on to say that Singapore is particularly at risk due to its falling birth rate and is almost on the verge of extinction. In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, “Singapore will go extinct in some time.” Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates. ""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates,"" wrote Vembu.In another post, Vembu made a similar observation about San Fancisco. He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks. It felt empty, particularly going from my Tenkasi village,"" wrote Vembu.

Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates.Japan suffered from this same problem in the 1980s and 90s. What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization. We need fresh thinking.","""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment.

Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide.

Or rather say is giving shoutout to a new catch phrase for xAI's AI chatbot Grok. In a post on Twitter, Elon Musk wrote an affirmative 'Yes' to a post from 'Tesla Owners Silicon Valley' that says: 'Don’t Google it. Grok it.' Grok is positioned it as competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT as well as Google Gemini and other AI Chatbots. 'Dumbhead...': Trump Aide 'Gets Ripped Apart' In US House After 'Parasite Class' Post | WatchNot just this, the account shares a series of post on Grok, and the reasons one should be using them. ""Grok 3 images are insanely real 🤯🤯,"" goes one. There are also other post that tell: 'How to download and install Grok?', 'How to use Deep Search with Grok AI?'An earlier post shared the meaning of the word Grok, quoting Elon Musk. ""Grok is a word from a Heinlein novel, Stranger in a Strange Land, and it's used by a guy who's raised on Mars.""For those unaware, Elon Musk founded xAI in 2023 as a counter to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Musk has openly criticized the OpenAI's shift toward a for-profit structure. Elon Musk has filed two lawsuits against OpenAI, alleging it has deviated from its original mission. His involvement with OpenAI dates back to its inception, though he parted ways with its board in 2018. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman dismissed Musk’s buyout attempt as a ploy to hinder their progress.Elon Musk also spoke about the Grok app in his recent podcast with the Youtuber Joe Rogan. The duo used 'Grok Unhinged Mode' In the podcast, Elon Musk asks: ""what is there in Fort Knox?"" They follow with another similar question: ""Do you think all the Gold is there in Fort Knox?"" In answer, the AI chatbot is seen kinda evading the sensitive question. As to those unaware what Fort Knox is? Fort Knox is the most famous repository for Gold in the US. Other than Fort Know, vast quantities of Gold are also reported to be held at mints in West Point, Denver and at the Federal Reserve vault in New York.Coming to the latest on Grok, Elon Musk's xAI recently unveiled an enhanced version of its Grok-3 chatbot. This launch comes shortly after OpenAI rejected Elon Musk's $97.4 billion offer to acquire its nonprofit division.

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk’s previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk’s stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‘want to kill me’During Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk’s actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk’s gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What’s relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you’re not invading Poland, maybe you’re not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don’t just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk’s leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk’s remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany’s history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany’s dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk’s alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan’s podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility. Whether this controversy will fade or escalate further will likely depend on Musk’s future actions and public responses.Also read | Airtel recharge plans | Jio recharge plans | BSNL recharge plans","What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.

Ashley's version of the storyAshley made the claim on social media and said she had to do this because tabloid media already got to know that Elon Musk is the father of her child. Then she sued Elon Musk seeking sole custody of the child. In her lawsuit, she attached screenshots of her chats with someone whose name she saved on her phone as 'EM'.

Elon Musk has often warned about declining populations in several Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Elon Musk even went on to say that Singapore is particularly at risk due to its falling birth rate and is almost on the verge of extinction. In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, “Singapore will go extinct in some time.” Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates. ""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates,"" wrote Vembu.In another post, Vembu made a similar observation about San Fancisco. He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks. It felt empty, particularly going from my Tenkasi village,"" wrote Vembu.

This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates.Japan suffered from this same problem in the 1980s and 90s. What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization.

In a post on Twitter, Elon Musk wrote an affirmative 'Yes' to a post from 'Tesla Owners Silicon Valley' that says: 'Don’t Google it. Grok it.' Grok is positioned it as competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT as well as Google Gemini and other AI Chatbots. 'Dumbhead...': Trump Aide 'Gets Ripped Apart' In US House After 'Parasite Class' Post | WatchNot just this, the account shares a series of post on Grok, and the reasons one should be using them. ""Grok 3 images are insanely real 🤯🤯,"" goes one. There are also other post that tell: 'How to download and install Grok?', 'How to use Deep Search with Grok AI?'An earlier post shared the meaning of the word Grok, quoting Elon Musk. ""Grok is a word from a Heinlein novel, Stranger in a Strange Land, and it's used by a guy who's raised on Mars.""For those unaware, Elon Musk founded xAI in 2023 as a counter to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Musk has openly criticized the OpenAI's shift toward a for-profit structure. Elon Musk has filed two lawsuits against OpenAI, alleging it has deviated from its original mission. His involvement with OpenAI dates back to its inception, though he parted ways with its board in 2018. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman dismissed Musk’s buyout attempt as a ploy to hinder their progress.Elon Musk also spoke about the Grok app in his recent podcast with the Youtuber Joe Rogan. The duo used 'Grok Unhinged Mode' In the podcast, Elon Musk asks: ""what is there in Fort Knox?"" They follow with another similar question: ""Do you think all the Gold is there in Fort Knox?"" In answer, the AI chatbot is seen kinda evading the sensitive question. As to those unaware what Fort Knox is? Fort Knox is the most famous repository for Gold in the US. Other than Fort Know, vast quantities of Gold are also reported to be held at mints in West Point, Denver and at the Federal Reserve vault in New York.Coming to the latest on Grok, Elon Musk's xAI recently unveiled an enhanced version of its Grok-3 chatbot. This launch comes shortly after OpenAI rejected Elon Musk's $97.4 billion offer to acquire its nonprofit division. During a livestream, xAI claimed that Grok-3 surpasses OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini, DeepSeek’s V3, and Anthropic’s Claude across various math, science, and coding benchmarks. Musk highlighted that Grok-3 boasts over ten times the computational power of its predecessor, with pre-training finalized in early January.These performance claims, yet to be independently verified, heat up the rivalry between xAI and OpenAI. Grok-3 is accessible to X Premium+ subscribers for $22 per month.","They follow with another similar question: ""Do you think all the Gold is there in Fort Knox?""

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk’s previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk’s stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‘want to kill me’During Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk’s actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk’s gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What’s relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you’re not invading Poland, maybe you’re not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don’t just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk’s leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk’s remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany’s history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany’s dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk’s alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan’s podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility. Whether this controversy will fade or escalate further will likely depend on Musk’s future actions and public responses.Also read | Airtel recharge plans | Jio recharge plans | BSNL recharge plans","What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.

Trump has also proposed annexing the country as the 51st state, is “against the national interest of Canada,” the petitioners claim.“He has used his wealth and power to influence our elections,” the petition claims. “He has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty.” Responding to the news about the petition, shared by a Twitter user, Elon Musk wrote: “Canada is not a real country.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk, however, later deleted the post.

On Saturday, several protesters were arrested outside a Tesla dealership in New York City, with some chanting, “We need clean air, not another billionaire,” according to the New York Post.Earlier in the week, around 350 demonstrators gathered outside a Tesla dealership in Portland, Oregon, chanting, “Elon Musk has got to go.” Last week, protests erupted at more than 50 Tesla stores across the US, with some demonstrations extending internationally to cities like Barcelona, London, and Lisbon.Many of these protests appear to be coordinated through the Tesla Takedown website, which encourages participants to “sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines.” The site lists the Troublemakers and Disruption Project organizations as sponsors—two groups mentioned in Musk’s recent post.","In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Musk stated, “An investigation has found 5 ActBlue-funded groups responsible for Tesla “protests”: Troublemakers, Disruption Project, Rise & Resist, Indivisible Project and Democratic Socialists of America.” He further named the funders of the groups that included George Soros, Reid Hoffman, Herbert Sandler, Patricia Bauman, and Leah Hunt-Hendrix.

Elon Musk has often warned about declining populations in several Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Elon Musk even went on to say that Singapore is particularly at risk due to its falling birth rate and is almost on the verge of extinction. In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, “Singapore will go extinct in some time.” Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates. ""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates,"" wrote Vembu.In another post, Vembu made a similar observation about San Fancisco. He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks. It felt empty, particularly going from my Tenkasi village,"" wrote Vembu.

This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates.Japan suffered from this same problem in the 1980s and 90s. What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization.

Or rather say is giving shoutout to a new catch phrase for xAI's AI chatbot Grok. In a post on Twitter, Elon Musk wrote an affirmative 'Yes' to a post from 'Tesla Owners Silicon Valley' that says: 'Don’t Google it. Grok it.' Grok is positioned it as competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT as well as Google Gemini and other AI Chatbots.

""Grok 3 images are insanely real 🤯🤯,"" goes one. There are also other post that tell: 'How to download and install Grok?', 'How to use Deep Search with Grok AI?'An earlier post shared the meaning of the word Grok, quoting Elon Musk. ""Grok is a word from a Heinlein novel, Stranger in a Strange Land, and it's used by a guy who's raised on Mars.""For those unaware, Elon Musk founded xAI in 2023 as a counter to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Musk has openly criticized the OpenAI's shift toward a for-profit structure. Elon Musk has filed two lawsuits against OpenAI, alleging it has deviated from its original mission. His involvement with OpenAI dates back to its inception, though he parted ways with its board in 2018. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman dismissed Musk’s buyout attempt as a ploy to hinder their progress.Elon Musk also spoke about the Grok app in his recent podcast with the Youtuber Joe Rogan. The duo used 'Grok Unhinged Mode' In the podcast, Elon Musk asks: ""what is there in Fort Knox?"" They follow with another similar question: ""Do you think all the Gold is there in Fort Knox?"" In answer, the AI chatbot is seen kinda evading the sensitive question. As to those unaware what Fort Knox is? Fort Knox is the most famous repository for Gold in the US. Other than Fort Know, vast quantities of Gold are also reported to be held at mints in West Point, Denver and at the Federal Reserve vault in New York.Coming to the latest on Grok, Elon Musk's xAI recently unveiled an enhanced version of its Grok-3 chatbot. This launch comes shortly after OpenAI rejected Elon Musk's $97.4 billion offer to acquire its nonprofit division. During a livestream, xAI claimed that Grok-3 surpasses OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini, DeepSeek’s V3, and Anthropic’s Claude across various math, science, and coding benchmarks. Musk highlighted that Grok-3 boasts over ten times the computational power of its predecessor, with pre-training finalized in early January.These performance claims, yet to be independently verified, heat up the rivalry between xAI and OpenAI. Grok-3 is accessible to X Premium+ subscribers for $22 per month.","They follow with another similar question: ""Do you think all the Gold is there in Fort Knox?""

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk’s previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk’s stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‘want to kill me’During Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk’s actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk’s gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What’s relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you’re not invading Poland, maybe you’re not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don’t just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk’s leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk’s remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany’s history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany’s dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk’s alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan’s podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility. Whether this controversy will fade or escalate further will likely depend on Musk’s future actions and public responses.Also read | Airtel recharge plans | Jio recharge plans | BSNL recharge plans","What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.

After Conservative influencer Ashley Clair claimed the father of her five-month-old son is Elon Musk and Elon Musk did not acknowledge it despite already having a number of children from different mothers, speculations are rife over what happened and why Elon Musk did not acknowledge his 13th child. Ashley's version of the storyAshley made the claim on social media and said she had to do this because tabloid media already got to know that Elon Musk is the father of her child. Then she sued Elon Musk seeking sole custody of the child. In her lawsuit, she attached screenshots of her chats with someone whose name she saved on her phone as 'EM'. EM asked her about her wellbeing after the childbirth and also said he wanted to 'knock her up again'.

Elon Musk asked her to keep it a secret and kept her in a luxurious apartment with a large security detail. She said Elon Musk met with the child only once and did not even ask for his photos.

So says a petition signed by more than 250,000 Canadian citizens and residents. The parliamentary petition urges Canada to revoke Elon Musk’s citizenship and passport. The petition, which opened to signatures late last week, accuses Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty. Elon Musk is one of the closest associates of the US President Donald Trump, who plans to levy a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports next month. Trump has also proposed annexing the country as the 51st state, is “against the national interest of Canada,” the petitioners claim.“He has used his wealth and power to influence our elections,” the petition claims. “He has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty.” Responding to the news about the petition, shared by a Twitter user, Elon Musk wrote: “Canada is not a real country.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk, however, later deleted the post. It is not certain why he deleted the post, considering he has been quite vocal about his opinion on a range of issues even if it is opposed by many. The petition is addressed to Justin Trudeau and sponsored by Charlie Angus, a member of Parliament for the left-of-center New Democratic Party. A petition, initiated on February 20 and currently supported by over 250,000 Canadian signatures, will remain available for signatures until June 20.Meanwhile, Musk's daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson, said in a post on Threads, ""I’m ngl this Canadian ’51st state’ s**t has upped my Canadian patriotism by about 5000000%”.How Elon Musk is a Canadian citizenBorn in Pretoria, South Africa, Elon Musk holds both Canadian and US citizenship.

In a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), Musk stated, “An investigation has found 5 ActBlue-funded groups responsible for Tesla “protests”: Troublemakers, Disruption Project, Rise & Resist, Indivisible Project and Democratic Socialists of America.” He further named the funders of the groups that included George Soros, Reid Hoffman, Herbert Sandler, Patricia Bauman, and Leah Hunt-Hendrix. This is not the first time Musk has singled out Soros, who is often the subject of unfounded conspiracy theories, or Hoffman, a LinkedIn co-founder and Democratic donor.Musk’s post follows a comment he made just a day earlier, where he said, “Something stinks about ActBlue,” in response to a post on X about seven senior ActBlue officials resigning at the end of February.

Elon Musk has often warned about declining populations in several Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Elon Musk even went on to say that Singapore is particularly at risk due to its falling birth rate and is almost on the verge of extinction. In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, “Singapore will go extinct in some time.” Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates. ""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates,"" wrote Vembu.In another post, Vembu made a similar observation about San Fancisco. He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks. It felt empty, particularly going from my Tenkasi village,"" wrote Vembu.

Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates.Japan suffered from this same problem in the 1980s and 90s. What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million.

For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide.

This intricate art form is not just limited to sculptures but extends to paintings, where a solidified ghee canvas is adorned with images of Lord Shiva, a unique tradition in the city's Maha Shivratri celebrations.Known as Ghee Na Kamal (the Lotus of Ghee), this tradition demands expert craftsmanship to ensure the ghee remains firm and does not melt at normal temperatures. These ghee-based creations are made from both pure and vegetable ghee. They are offered to Lord Shiva during prayers, a practice upheld by a handful of families who have preserved the art for generations. Thought to have originated around 400 years ago in the city's Shiva temples, this rare skill is slowly fading.Pure ghee from Jam Khambhaliya, used in these creations, costs around Rs 1,000 per kg, whereas the more affordable vegetable ghee is available for less than Rs 150 per kg. Interior designer Snehal Jariwala, whose family has been making Ghee Na Kamal for generations, said, ""This offering has been a sacred tradition in Surat's ancient Shiva temples for centuries. Just as milk is offered to the deity, ghee symbolises purity, an offering of our purest selves to Lord Shiva.""Jariwala's family inherited this craft from their ancestors and does not charge for making the lotus, as the ghee is donated by devotees. ""Over time, people began shaping the ghee by solidifying it,"" she added. Prabodh Patrawala, an artisan who makes ghee lotuses and paintings on request, describes the intricate process: ""We first beat the ghee by hand in a specific technique without using spoons. After a while, it thickens into the desired form, then it is warmed to a precise temperature.""Once Shivratri concludes, the ghee from these offerings is repurposed for temple lamps. It transforms into a texture unsuitable for consumption, though in some temples, small portions of it are distributed as prasad. ""We have a Shiva temple at home, and every Shivratri, we offer a Ghee Na Kamal. This tradition was started by our ancestors, and we continue to honour it,"" said Nitin Bhajiyawala, who donates a 1.25 kg Jam Khambhaliya ghee lotus every year.A Fading ArtThe process involves pouring the thickened ghee into trays or frames, where it solidifies at room temperature. Creating a small lotus takes four to five hours, while a detailed painting requires over a day. Larger pieces can take several days to complete. A handful of families still practice this art, as younger generations show little interest in learning it. ""I picked up the skill while assisting my elders. My expertise in solidifying ghee led me to be invited by the royal families of Vansada and Dharampur to craft these lotuses for them,"" said Prakash Jariwala, a zari artisan. During Shivratri, young girls from his neighbourhood join in the process, keeping the tradition alive—at least for now.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","Thought to have originated around 400 years ago in the city's Shiva temples, this rare skill is slowly fading.Pure ghee from Jam Khambhaliya, used in these creations, costs around Rs 1,000 per kg, whereas the more affordable vegetable ghee is available for less than Rs 150 per kg.

He shared that despite the success he is gaining from the show, some still believe his family name got him the opportunity.The actor, who plays Saxton Ratliff in the new season of HBO’s hit series, explained that his journey in the industry has not been easy. He revealed that he has spent over a decade taking acting classes, performing in school plays, and going through countless auditions—many of which resulted in rejection.In an interview with The Sunday Times, “I know people think I got this role just because of my dad,” Schwarzenegger said. “But they don’t see the years of training, the hours I’ve put into developing characters, or the many auditions I didn’t get. Of course, it’s frustrating. There are moments when I think, I wish I didn’t have my last name, but those feelings pass quickly.”Despite the challenges, Schwarzenegger made it clear that he appreciates the life he has. “I would never trade my life with anyone,” he added. “I’m lucky to have the family I do, and I’m grateful for the lessons and values my parents have given me.”Speaking to People magazine earlier this month, he also mentioned that he still attends weekly acting classes to improve his craft. However, he credited his father’s career for sparking his love for acting. “I used to visit my dad on set all the time,” he shared. “He would take me out of school early, and I’d watch him transform into different characters. I remember sitting on set, watching him go in as my dad and come out as Mr. Freeze. I was completely fascinated by the whole process.”Arnold Schwarzenegger, who attended the White Lotus Season 3 premiere, proudly supported his son. He even posted about it on Instagram, jokingly reacting to Patrick’s role. “I was so excited to take a break from filming to celebrate [Patrick] at The White Lotus premiere,” Arnold wrote. “What a show!

Everyone is asking if Jennifer Coolidge, the star who portrayed the favorite Tanya McQuoid, will have an unexpected return considering the new location and predominantly new cast.Unfortunately for Tanya fans, the answer is no. Her narrative came to a conclusive and dramatic end in Season 2. The season began with a doomy death, which was later established as Tanya's own untimely demise. She was involved with a set of fishy rich men, eventually resorting to taking things into her own hands in a last-ditch effort to stay alive. In a wild turn of events, Tanya murdered all on a yacht before tragically slipping and hitting her head in attempting to flee, ultimately dying. The creator of the series, Mike White, stated that Tanya's death was intended to be ironic as well as appropriate given her character progression.To everyone's surprise, Greg, the widower of Tanya, played by Jon Gries, is set to appear in the Season 3 premiere. He is not the main character for the new season, but his appearance leaves some curious questions regarding Tanya's passing. He gets a brief mention from his new young girlfriend when she is drinking at a bar. It appears Greg is on vacation at a different White Lotus resort, this time in Thailand, apparently basking in Tanya's inherited wealth.

Rick often dismissed Chelsea’s upbeat personality, and their significant 22-year age gap made their dynamic even more intriguing. However, in the second episode, a different side of their relationship was shown when they shared an intimate moment.While filming the scene, Wood felt safe and supported. She worked closely with intimacy coordinator Miriam Lucia, co-star Walton Goggins, and showrunner Mike White to ensure everyone involved was comfortable. Speaking to ELLE.com before the season’s premiere, Wood expressed her appreciation for intimacy coordinators, calling them “absolutely essential.” She explained that Lucia made the process feel natural rather than overly formal, allowing the actors to take the lead in shaping the scene.Wood revealed that she and Goggins planned their intimate scenes together, discussing their vision for how the moment should unfold. They felt it was important to show tenderness between their characters, especially since Rick was not always affectionate toward Chelsea in other parts of the show. They agreed that the scene should not feel unnecessary or overly explicit but instead convey an emotional connection.In a career first for Wood, Lucia, with White’s approval, allowed her to review the scene after filming. White assured Wood that if she was uncomfortable with anything, changes could be made, including cutting parts of the sequence. Lucia emphasized that Wood’s consent was the priority, reminding her that since it was her body on screen, she had the final say. After watching the scene, Wood decided it was important to keep it, as it highlighted a part of Chelsea and Rick’s relationship that wouldn’t have been seen otherwise.Having previously worked on Netflix’s Sex Education, Wood was no stranger to filming intimate scenes. However, she admitted that experience made her more mindful about their purpose in storytelling. She explained that earlier in her career, she would agree to scenes without questioning their necessity, but now she carefully considers whether a moment can be conveyed through subtle expressions rather than nudity.Interestingly, the intimate scenes in The White Lotus weren’t the most intimidating part of filming for Wood. She confessed that what actually made her nervous was wearing bikinis on screen, showing that even experienced actors have their own personal challenges on set.","She worked closely with intimacy coordinator Miriam Lucia, co-star Walton Goggins, and showrunner Mike White to ensure everyone involved was comfortable.

lotus, Best Team Compositions For Every Valorant Map ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/valorant/best-team-compositions-for-every-valorant-map/articleshow/118714773.cms," Mar 04, 2025, 21:24 (IST)","Image via: Riot Valorant’s strategic depth comes from experimenting with different team compositions, Valorant has a remarkable degree of strategic depth in that player experimentation changes compositions with agents crafted toward the peculiarities of each map. Understanding what compositions work in what maps can be the deciding factor on casual ranks or during serious match strategizing. Here's how to dissect some of the best team compositions for some of the most played maps in Valorant.1. Fracture: Where Aggression Meets ControlOne of the most dynamic maps among all, Fracture offers much space for aggressive plays and unique angles. When Fracture is expected to return to the competitive pick pool, this composition will presumably be a go-to choice for ranked and pro matches.Duelist: NeonController: AstraSentinel: ChamberInitiators: Breach, FadeThe Best Team Comps on EVERY MAP in Patch 9.07!With her extraordinary movement and staggering abilities, Neon excels at aggressive area control. When Breach is on Neon’s team, they generally have a great power synergy due to Breach’s utilities perfectly complementing Neon’s velocity in making quick pushes. Fade provides much-needed intel on enemy location, and Astra’s gravitational pull works well for slowing down movement through vital choke points, creating opportunities for different plays. Chamber adds a more defensive approach by creating space with his long-range duels and Trademark to deter enemy advancement. 2. Lotus: Simplicity and DominanceLotus is very much a map where simplicity can play a big role. Though compositions with Viper and two controllers can work here, the composition thus favors utilizing the most utility and control while keeping pressure onto the site.Duelist: RazeController: OmenSentinel: KilljoyInitiators: Fade, Gekko3. Pearl: Unconventional but PowerfulBecause of Pearl's rich geography and its high-value zones like B long, it is one of the maps where the offbeat compositions can excel-potent. It may look quirky at first but makes for a serious punch if the execution is right.Duelist: Neon, YoruController: AstraSentinel: ChamberInitiator: Fade50 Game Changing Valorant Tips in 10 MINUTES | Valorant Tips, Tricks, and GuidesIn fact, the most wonderful combination in Pearl could be Neon and Yoru contesting B long. In addition, they are both quite effective. Because Neon can gain such speed, and Yoru can teleport, he will control that area quickly. While fully benefiting from Astra's universal utility throughout the map, Chamber's precision and versatility seem to allow him to hold long angles or high-stakes fights. So much Fade is about intel grabbing to find enemy locations in order to assure your team has a lead on the intel game. 4. Abyss: Balanced Utility and Map ControlAbyss is indeed a neat and large map for open spaces and numerous lanes. Thus, it would require some good balance in terms of having mixed utility and defense, as it is a well-balanced combination of control, vision, and flexibility for anything.Duelist: JettController: AstraSentinel: CypherInitiators: KayO, SovaOn high-speed play and mobility, Jett can be an absolute game-changer on Abyss, especially for aggressive rotations and site pushes. Astra's smokes and gravity well manipulations are more useful in controlling certain areas of the map. Cypher provides the most map control with his tripwires and camera to discourage flanking. Kayo and Sova yield excellent utility for clearing vision while providing intel. Sova's recon darts are not at all bad in open areas, while some flashes emitted by KayO add value in constricted areas, especially during pushes or defending sites. Every agent brings into play particular strengths, and recognizing good synergies can win or lose a game. Therefore, you create compositions that optimize utility, map control, and, in general, strategic advantage by careful selection of agents that accurately complement each other. So, whenever you are drawing up your team next time, this should be borne in mind: It is not just about selecting your favorite agent; it is about the right tools for the job.","When Fracture is expected to return to the competitive pick pool, this composition will presumably be a go-to choice for ranked and pro matches.Duelist: NeonController: AstraSentinel: ChamberInitiators: Breach, FadeThe Best Team Comps on EVERY MAP in Patch 9.07!With her extraordinary movement and staggering abilities, Neon excels at aggressive area control.

The actor, known for his performances in films such as ""The Patriot"", ""Black Hawk Down"", ""The Death of Stalin"", and the ""Harry Potter"" franchise, said the trip to India was quite transformative for him. ""Hotel Mumbai"" was based on the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.""I think about transformation a lot because I'm older... And I think probably the first time I really thought a lot about it was when I worked in India. Well, they made a film called 'Hotel Mumbai'. ""We travelled around India a lot and we saw the highs and the lows and the massive wealth gap there. It does make you reflect on what material possessions mean... It's something that I think about all the time,"" Isaacs told PTI in a roundtable interview. His new show ""The White Lotus"" focuses on a group of tourists and how their lives change during the course of an ultra luxury vacation and Isaacs said he had a similar experience in Thailand where the third season of the HBO show is set. ""I made some friends but also got to see a country where people live very differently with massive disparity. We're actors, we're endlessly curious about who people are, how they are, and choices they make. And also for me, different cultures, different politics, different attitudes to life and death... So, it was a very three-dimensional experience."" ""The White Lotus"", which currently streams on JioHotstar, is created by Mike White. Each season of the show revolves around the dynamics between rich guests and employees of a fictional resort chain, called White Lotus. The first season was set in Hawaii and the second season was shot in Sicily, Italy. ""Mike chose Thailand for a reason because people go there for a spiritual odyssey as well as for all the normally entertaining things. He wanted to make the series have more resonance and he achieved it in spades,"" the 61-year-old actor said. Isaacs plays the role of Timothy Ratliff, a US-based financier, who visits the resort with his family -- wife Victoria (Parker Posey), sons Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), Lochlan (Sam Nivola) and daughter Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook). While on vacation, Ratliff gets to know that his business is in serious trouble. ""I had some big acting to do. I mean, there's some extreme emotions. There's a pressure cooker which is exploding... His entire life and future. And along with all the other sex, drugs, and tofu that Mike writes about, this series has questions of identity and what is the self,"" he said about the new season. According to Isaacs, the USP of White's writing is that it can't be slotted into easy categories. ""There are no cliches here. What he does so brilliantly is that you meet the characters and you think you understand who they are. Sometimes you can even make comparisons with previous characters in the show, but he's far too sophisticated for that. ""So how does it compare? Timothy is Timothy, and there's no one like him specifically, and his particular dilemma has never been seen before,"" he added. In his long career, Isaacs has played some of the most compelling characters whether it is Lucius Malfoy from the ""Harry Potter"" movies, Colonel William Tavington in ""The Patriot"" or Georgy Zhukov in ""The Death of Stalin"". Asked about his fascination for morally complex characters, the actor said they are the most interesting parts. ""The last thing I want to do, if I get the choice, is to be in something that finishes and people go, 'That was good. What should we eat?' I'd rather have it finished and people have a discussion. The discussion starts when the credits roll. And that's what Mike Wight writes,"" he added. Season three of ""The White Lotus"" also features Leslie Bibb, Carrie Coon, Walton Goggins, Michelle Monaghan, Lek Patravadi, Lalisa Manobal, Tayme Thapthimthong and Aimee Lou Wood.

Thousands of birds and scores of birders and tourists who converged at the scenic spot have been missing in recent years.Goa’s only important bird and biodiversity area (IBA) now appears to be a better home to Indian mugger crocodilesthan waders and other avifauna. “We are not aware of any forest department study of the lake as a bird habitat. But it appears that it is being considered more as a crocodile habitat now,” said Dinesh Usgaonkar, a biodiversity management committee (BMC) member.With the lake full to the brim round the year, the crocodile population seems to have increased over the years, though theirs is a peaceful coexistence with residents on its banks.“If the lake was dry, they would have relocated elsewhere. We are not against crocodiles, but their habitat is the nearby Cumbharjua canal,” Usgaonkar said.Cumbharjua MLA Rajesh Faldesai has petitioned the forest department to relocate the reptiles to Bondla zoo due to local concerns.But forest department sources said that it is not feasible to do so. Sources said the crocodile population is more visible during the breeding season in summer and disperses subsequently.In the past, when the lake’s sluice gate would be opened around late April and closed around Aug-Sep, a whole ecological cycle of breeding and rejuvenation for aquatic flora and fauna would begin.“The water was released for the adjoining paddy field after the harvest. Once dry, the tortoise would emerge and the seed from lotuses would be embedded on lakebed for germination,” said Devanand Kawlekar, BMC chairman.Around two decades ago, an order of the high court of Bombay at Goa made the forest department the lake’s custodian. Sometime later, the sluice gate was shut, triggering the lake’s slow ecological degradation.“In the past, its ecosystem was vibrant with hundreds of lotuses and other aquatic biodiversity. During rains, paddy cultivation was done in the lake (Tollem) followed by storing of water for rabi crops after harvest,” said Kawlekar, an ecologist.Carambolim lake was a hotspot for birders even before the railway station was set up in part of its area. In the lake’s glory days, birders, including Heinz Lanier, had reported waders in thousands.Birding as an activity was pioneered here and Goa Bird Conservation Network and other birders have reported 306 bird species in Carambolim lake including nearby Dhado wetland complex.“When the lake was emptied, the birds fed on worms and molluscs, but now hardly any vegetation grows in it,” Kawlekar said.The forest department has created islands in the lake for birds. “But if there is no food, birds will not come,” he added.The traditional practice of releasing water helped the lake’s ecosystem and paddy cultivation.“Releasing water is crucial in maintaining hydrological balance as the inflow of water helps recharge, maintain clarity of water and enable regular supply of oxygen to the lake’s ecosystem,” said Vaishnavi Naik, former Goa University student from the department of zoology.The monsoon does facilitate the upcycling process for the aquatic flora and fauna. “But the lifecycle of organisms can be affected as they have to wait for another monsoon for the same cycle,” Naik said.Aerial and other living organisms have easier access to oxygen. “The aquatic flora and fauna critically depend on dissolved oxygen. This includes hydrophytes— the floating and submerged plants like lotuses, water lilies and animals like turtles, fishes, larvae of insects, amphibians and others,” Naik said.Now, no vegetation grows, as the seed of lotuses and other plants rots under submerged conditions. “Forget birds and fishes, even locals would eat parts of lotuses like bonge,” Usgaonkar said.The native fish species in the lake are also on a decline, though for unknown reasons. “There were inzullam, gonje (like catfish), tigur, godke and even konge aplenty, but now one finds only Tilapia, an invasive species,” Usgaonkar said.Excess nutrients from agricultural and domestic run offs can lead to eutrophication in the absence of water restoration and agricultural practices, Naik said.Some evidence of eutrophication can be seen. “Presence of algal blooms and echornia (called locally as frog’s thighs) needs to be studied,” Kawlekar said.Plans are afoot to carry out biochemical testing of water with an agency. “Otherwise, even releasing the water for two years on an experimental basis would help understand the advantages of maintaining hydrological balance,” Kawlekar said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","“Forget birds and fishes, even locals would eat parts of lotuses like bonge,” Usgaonkar said.The native fish species in the lake are also on a decline, though for unknown reasons. “Otherwise, even releasing the water for two years on an experimental basis would help understand the advantages of maintaining hydrological balance,” Kawlekar said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march."
lotus, Tattoos: The Energy Portals Nobody Warned About ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/astrology/others/tattoos-the-energy-portals-nobody-warned-about/articleshow/118706921.cms," Mar 04, 2025, 18:30 (IST)","Tattoos aren’t just ink on skin—they’re cosmic WiFi signals connecting straight to the universe. Every symbol, phrase, or questionable late-night decision permanently etched onto skin becomes an energetic portal, whether it was meant to or not. Some call it self-expression, but let’s be honest—it's basically an ancient spell, except instead of a wand, it's done with a buzzing needle and mild regret. Symbols hold power. Slap a lotus on the wrist, and suddenly, there’s a direct hotline to spiritual awakening. Get a wolf howling at the moon? Now there’s an energy field summoning the inner lone wolf (or at least an irresistible urge to buy leather jackets). The more intentional the tattoo, the stronger the energy, which explains why some people walk around radiating Main Character energy while others look like they lost a bet. Ever notice how certain tattoos mark a life shift? That’s not coincidence—that’s cosmic coding. A heartbreak tattoo invites transformation, a phoenix tattoo basically demands a glow-up, and anything done in a foreign language without double-checking the meaning is bound to summon unintentional chaos. Ancient cultures already knew the deal. Warriors, shamans, and rockstars of the past (and present) inked themselves up, not just for aesthetics but to channel strength, protection, and, in some cases, to make sure the afterlife bouncer lets them in. Whether it’s a talisman, a personal mantra, or a tiny avocado, every tattoo carries an energetic signature, shaping the future in ways science hasn't quite caught up with yet. So, is every tattoo a portal? Absolutely. Some open doorways to transformation, others just lead straight to awkward small talk with strangers who also have infinity symbols. Either way, once the ink is in, the energy is set.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder.""

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

The report said though US law generally prohibits non-citizens from working for the federal government, Elon Musk was hoping for an exception for Baris Akis, but the answer was an unequivocal no -- delivered to Musk by Trump's advisers. The message delivered to him was that Trump's White House is in the business of deporting people, and bringing in a foreign national to help shrink the government's American workforce would send a confusing message, the report said. Elon Muk and his team accepted the argument and ""moved on"", the report said amid Musk's growing influence in the government as he announced that he would shut down USAID to which President Trump too agreed. As Elon Musk's influence is worrying for even some MAGA voices, Trump recently said that Elon Musk won't do anything without the administration's approval. “Elon can’t do and won’t do anything without our approval. And we will give him the approval where appropriate, and where not appropriate we won’t,” the president said Monday in the Oval Office.

""Davis and Akis have been heavily involved in the Office of Personnel Management in recent weeks. But neither of them actually work there.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

But to be successful in India is not an easy job,"" Jindal said.Elon Musk’s Tesla is reportedly all set to enter Indian shores. The company has reportedly finalised the location for its first showroom in the country.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

This intricate art form is not just limited to sculptures but extends to paintings, where a solidified ghee canvas is adorned with images of Lord Shiva, a unique tradition in the city's Maha Shivratri celebrations.Known as Ghee Na Kamal (the Lotus of Ghee), this tradition demands expert craftsmanship to ensure the ghee remains firm and does not melt at normal temperatures. These ghee-based creations are made from both pure and vegetable ghee. They are offered to Lord Shiva during prayers, a practice upheld by a handful of families who have preserved the art for generations. Thought to have originated around 400 years ago in the city's Shiva temples, this rare skill is slowly fading.Pure ghee from Jam Khambhaliya, used in these creations, costs around Rs 1,000 per kg, whereas the more affordable vegetable ghee is available for less than Rs 150 per kg. Interior designer Snehal Jariwala, whose family has been making Ghee Na Kamal for generations, said, ""This offering has been a sacred tradition in Surat's ancient Shiva temples for centuries. Just as milk is offered to the deity, ghee symbolises purity, an offering of our purest selves to Lord Shiva.""Jariwala's family inherited this craft from their ancestors and does not charge for making the lotus, as the ghee is donated by devotees. ""Over time, people began shaping the ghee by solidifying it,"" she added. Prabodh Patrawala, an artisan who makes ghee lotuses and paintings on request, describes the intricate process: ""We first beat the ghee by hand in a specific technique without using spoons. After a while, it thickens into the desired form, then it is warmed to a precise temperature.""Once Shivratri concludes, the ghee from these offerings is repurposed for temple lamps. It transforms into a texture unsuitable for consumption, though in some temples, small portions of it are distributed as prasad. ""We have a Shiva temple at home, and every Shivratri, we offer a Ghee Na Kamal. This tradition was started by our ancestors, and we continue to honour it,"" said Nitin Bhajiyawala, who donates a 1.25 kg Jam Khambhaliya ghee lotus every year.A Fading ArtThe process involves pouring the thickened ghee into trays or frames, where it solidifies at room temperature. Creating a small lotus takes four to five hours, while a detailed painting requires over a day. Larger pieces can take several days to complete. A handful of families still practice this art, as younger generations show little interest in learning it. ""I picked up the skill while assisting my elders. My expertise in solidifying ghee led me to be invited by the royal families of Vansada and Dharampur to craft these lotuses for them,"" said Prakash Jariwala, a zari artisan. During Shivratri, young girls from his neighbourhood join in the process, keeping the tradition alive—at least for now.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","Thought to have originated around 400 years ago in the city's Shiva temples, this rare skill is slowly fading.Pure ghee from Jam Khambhaliya, used in these creations, costs around Rs 1,000 per kg, whereas the more affordable vegetable ghee is available for less than Rs 150 per kg.

Everyone is asking if Jennifer Coolidge, the star who portrayed the favorite Tanya McQuoid, will have an unexpected return considering the new location and predominantly new cast.Unfortunately for Tanya fans, the answer is no. Her narrative came to a conclusive and dramatic end in Season 2. The season began with a doomy death, which was later established as Tanya's own untimely demise. She was involved with a set of fishy rich men, eventually resorting to taking things into her own hands in a last-ditch effort to stay alive. In a wild turn of events, Tanya murdered all on a yacht before tragically slipping and hitting her head in attempting to flee, ultimately dying. The creator of the series, Mike White, stated that Tanya's death was intended to be ironic as well as appropriate given her character progression.To everyone's surprise, Greg, the widower of Tanya, played by Jon Gries, is set to appear in the Season 3 premiere. He is not the main character for the new season, but his appearance leaves some curious questions regarding Tanya's passing. He gets a brief mention from his new young girlfriend when she is drinking at a bar. It appears Greg is on vacation at a different White Lotus resort, this time in Thailand, apparently basking in Tanya's inherited wealth. But his ""tired-looking appearance"" suggests that he might still be troubled by the happenings of last season.Natasha Rothwell's character, Belinda, the spa manager from Season 1, is also making a comeback. Viewers may recall how Tanya emotionally bribed Belinda in Hawaii. Belinda now reappears in Thailand, where she is receiving instruction in conventional methods of relaxation.Given her past with Tanya, Belinda's homecoming sets up a potentially violent confrontation between her and Greg. Will Greg's arrival be merely a brief allusion to the past, or could Belinda discover the real reason for Tanya's death?The return of Belinda and Greg, along with a new crew and a global backdrop, promises another thrilling installment in the ‘White Lotus’ saga as viewers look forward to the Season 3 launch.","The season began with a doomy death, which was later established as Tanya's own untimely demise.

Rick often dismissed Chelsea’s upbeat personality, and their significant 22-year age gap made their dynamic even more intriguing. However, in the second episode, a different side of their relationship was shown when they shared an intimate moment.While filming the scene, Wood felt safe and supported. She worked closely with intimacy coordinator Miriam Lucia, co-star Walton Goggins, and showrunner Mike White to ensure everyone involved was comfortable. Speaking to ELLE.com before the season’s premiere, Wood expressed her appreciation for intimacy coordinators, calling them “absolutely essential.” She explained that Lucia made the process feel natural rather than overly formal, allowing the actors to take the lead in shaping the scene.Wood revealed that she and Goggins planned their intimate scenes together, discussing their vision for how the moment should unfold. They felt it was important to show tenderness between their characters, especially since Rick was not always affectionate toward Chelsea in other parts of the show. They agreed that the scene should not feel unnecessary or overly explicit but instead convey an emotional connection.In a career first for Wood, Lucia, with White’s approval, allowed her to review the scene after filming. White assured Wood that if she was uncomfortable with anything, changes could be made, including cutting parts of the sequence. Lucia emphasized that Wood’s consent was the priority, reminding her that since it was her body on screen, she had the final say. After watching the scene, Wood decided it was important to keep it, as it highlighted a part of Chelsea and Rick’s relationship that wouldn’t have been seen otherwise.Having previously worked on Netflix’s Sex Education, Wood was no stranger to filming intimate scenes. However, she admitted that experience made her more mindful about their purpose in storytelling. She explained that earlier in her career, she would agree to scenes without questioning their necessity, but now she carefully considers whether a moment can be conveyed through subtle expressions rather than nudity.Interestingly, the intimate scenes in The White Lotus weren’t the most intimidating part of filming for Wood. She confessed that what actually made her nervous was wearing bikinis on screen, showing that even experienced actors have their own personal challenges on set.","She worked closely with intimacy coordinator Miriam Lucia, co-star Walton Goggins, and showrunner Mike White to ensure everyone involved was comfortable.

lotus, Best Team Compositions For Every Valorant Map ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/valorant/best-team-compositions-for-every-valorant-map/articleshow/118714773.cms," Mar 04, 2025, 21:24 (IST)","Image via: Riot Valorant’s strategic depth comes from experimenting with different team compositions, Valorant has a remarkable degree of strategic depth in that player experimentation changes compositions with agents crafted toward the peculiarities of each map. Understanding what compositions work in what maps can be the deciding factor on casual ranks or during serious match strategizing. Here's how to dissect some of the best team compositions for some of the most played maps in Valorant.1. Fracture: Where Aggression Meets ControlOne of the most dynamic maps among all, Fracture offers much space for aggressive plays and unique angles. When Fracture is expected to return to the competitive pick pool, this composition will presumably be a go-to choice for ranked and pro matches.Duelist: NeonController: AstraSentinel: ChamberInitiators: Breach, FadeThe Best Team Comps on EVERY MAP in Patch 9.07!With her extraordinary movement and staggering abilities, Neon excels at aggressive area control. When Breach is on Neon’s team, they generally have a great power synergy due to Breach’s utilities perfectly complementing Neon’s velocity in making quick pushes. Fade provides much-needed intel on enemy location, and Astra’s gravitational pull works well for slowing down movement through vital choke points, creating opportunities for different plays. Chamber adds a more defensive approach by creating space with his long-range duels and Trademark to deter enemy advancement. 2. Lotus: Simplicity and DominanceLotus is very much a map where simplicity can play a big role. Though compositions with Viper and two controllers can work here, the composition thus favors utilizing the most utility and control while keeping pressure onto the site.Duelist: RazeController: OmenSentinel: KilljoyInitiators: Fade, Gekko3. Pearl: Unconventional but PowerfulBecause of Pearl's rich geography and its high-value zones like B long, it is one of the maps where the offbeat compositions can excel-potent. It may look quirky at first but makes for a serious punch if the execution is right.Duelist: Neon, YoruController: AstraSentinel: ChamberInitiator: Fade50 Game Changing Valorant Tips in 10 MINUTES | Valorant Tips, Tricks, and GuidesIn fact, the most wonderful combination in Pearl could be Neon and Yoru contesting B long. In addition, they are both quite effective. Because Neon can gain such speed, and Yoru can teleport, he will control that area quickly. While fully benefiting from Astra's universal utility throughout the map, Chamber's precision and versatility seem to allow him to hold long angles or high-stakes fights. So much Fade is about intel grabbing to find enemy locations in order to assure your team has a lead on the intel game. 4. Abyss: Balanced Utility and Map ControlAbyss is indeed a neat and large map for open spaces and numerous lanes. Thus, it would require some good balance in terms of having mixed utility and defense, as it is a well-balanced combination of control, vision, and flexibility for anything.Duelist: JettController: AstraSentinel: CypherInitiators: KayO, SovaOn high-speed play and mobility, Jett can be an absolute game-changer on Abyss, especially for aggressive rotations and site pushes. Astra's smokes and gravity well manipulations are more useful in controlling certain areas of the map. Cypher provides the most map control with his tripwires and camera to discourage flanking. Kayo and Sova yield excellent utility for clearing vision while providing intel. Sova's recon darts are not at all bad in open areas, while some flashes emitted by KayO add value in constricted areas, especially during pushes or defending sites. Every agent brings into play particular strengths, and recognizing good synergies can win or lose a game. Therefore, you create compositions that optimize utility, map control, and, in general, strategic advantage by careful selection of agents that accurately complement each other. So, whenever you are drawing up your team next time, this should be borne in mind: It is not just about selecting your favorite agent; it is about the right tools for the job.","When Fracture is expected to return to the competitive pick pool, this composition will presumably be a go-to choice for ranked and pro matches.Duelist: NeonController: AstraSentinel: ChamberInitiators: Breach, FadeThe Best Team Comps on EVERY MAP in Patch 9.07!With her extraordinary movement and staggering abilities, Neon excels at aggressive area control.

The actor, known for his performances in films such as ""The Patriot"", ""Black Hawk Down"", ""The Death of Stalin"", and the ""Harry Potter"" franchise, said the trip to India was quite transformative for him. ""Hotel Mumbai"" was based on the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.""I think about transformation a lot because I'm older... And I think probably the first time I really thought a lot about it was when I worked in India. Well, they made a film called 'Hotel Mumbai'. ""We travelled around India a lot and we saw the highs and the lows and the massive wealth gap there. It does make you reflect on what material possessions mean... It's something that I think about all the time,"" Isaacs told PTI in a roundtable interview. His new show ""The White Lotus"" focuses on a group of tourists and how their lives change during the course of an ultra luxury vacation and Isaacs said he had a similar experience in Thailand where the third season of the HBO show is set. ""I made some friends but also got to see a country where people live very differently with massive disparity. We're actors, we're endlessly curious about who people are, how they are, and choices they make. And also for me, different cultures, different politics, different attitudes to life and death... So, it was a very three-dimensional experience."" ""The White Lotus"", which currently streams on JioHotstar, is created by Mike White. Each season of the show revolves around the dynamics between rich guests and employees of a fictional resort chain, called White Lotus. The first season was set in Hawaii and the second season was shot in Sicily, Italy. ""Mike chose Thailand for a reason because people go there for a spiritual odyssey as well as for all the normally entertaining things. He wanted to make the series have more resonance and he achieved it in spades,"" the 61-year-old actor said. Isaacs plays the role of Timothy Ratliff, a US-based financier, who visits the resort with his family -- wife Victoria (Parker Posey), sons Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), Lochlan (Sam Nivola) and daughter Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook). While on vacation, Ratliff gets to know that his business is in serious trouble. ""I had some big acting to do. I mean, there's some extreme emotions. There's a pressure cooker which is exploding... His entire life and future. And along with all the other sex, drugs, and tofu that Mike writes about, this series has questions of identity and what is the self,"" he said about the new season. According to Isaacs, the USP of White's writing is that it can't be slotted into easy categories. ""There are no cliches here. What he does so brilliantly is that you meet the characters and you think you understand who they are. Sometimes you can even make comparisons with previous characters in the show, but he's far too sophisticated for that. ""So how does it compare? Timothy is Timothy, and there's no one like him specifically, and his particular dilemma has never been seen before,"" he added. In his long career, Isaacs has played some of the most compelling characters whether it is Lucius Malfoy from the ""Harry Potter"" movies, Colonel William Tavington in ""The Patriot"" or Georgy Zhukov in ""The Death of Stalin"". Asked about his fascination for morally complex characters, the actor said they are the most interesting parts. ""The last thing I want to do, if I get the choice, is to be in something that finishes and people go, 'That was good. What should we eat?' I'd rather have it finished and people have a discussion. The discussion starts when the credits roll. And that's what Mike Wight writes,"" he added. Season three of ""The White Lotus"" also features Leslie Bibb, Carrie Coon, Walton Goggins, Michelle Monaghan, Lek Patravadi, Lalisa Manobal, Tayme Thapthimthong and Aimee Lou Wood.

Thousands of birds and scores of birders and tourists who converged at the scenic spot have been missing in recent years.Goa’s only important bird and biodiversity area (IBA) now appears to be a better home to Indian mugger crocodilesthan waders and other avifauna. “We are not aware of any forest department study of the lake as a bird habitat. But it appears that it is being considered more as a crocodile habitat now,” said Dinesh Usgaonkar, a biodiversity management committee (BMC) member.With the lake full to the brim round the year, the crocodile population seems to have increased over the years, though theirs is a peaceful coexistence with residents on its banks.“If the lake was dry, they would have relocated elsewhere. We are not against crocodiles, but their habitat is the nearby Cumbharjua canal,” Usgaonkar said.Cumbharjua MLA Rajesh Faldesai has petitioned the forest department to relocate the reptiles to Bondla zoo due to local concerns.But forest department sources said that it is not feasible to do so. Sources said the crocodile population is more visible during the breeding season in summer and disperses subsequently.In the past, when the lake’s sluice gate would be opened around late April and closed around Aug-Sep, a whole ecological cycle of breeding and rejuvenation for aquatic flora and fauna would begin.“The water was released for the adjoining paddy field after the harvest. Once dry, the tortoise would emerge and the seed from lotuses would be embedded on lakebed for germination,” said Devanand Kawlekar, BMC chairman.Around two decades ago, an order of the high court of Bombay at Goa made the forest department the lake’s custodian. Sometime later, the sluice gate was shut, triggering the lake’s slow ecological degradation.“In the past, its ecosystem was vibrant with hundreds of lotuses and other aquatic biodiversity. During rains, paddy cultivation was done in the lake (Tollem) followed by storing of water for rabi crops after harvest,” said Kawlekar, an ecologist.Carambolim lake was a hotspot for birders even before the railway station was set up in part of its area. In the lake’s glory days, birders, including Heinz Lanier, had reported waders in thousands.Birding as an activity was pioneered here and Goa Bird Conservation Network and other birders have reported 306 bird species in Carambolim lake including nearby Dhado wetland complex.“When the lake was emptied, the birds fed on worms and molluscs, but now hardly any vegetation grows in it,” Kawlekar said.The forest department has created islands in the lake for birds. “But if there is no food, birds will not come,” he added.The traditional practice of releasing water helped the lake’s ecosystem and paddy cultivation.“Releasing water is crucial in maintaining hydrological balance as the inflow of water helps recharge, maintain clarity of water and enable regular supply of oxygen to the lake’s ecosystem,” said Vaishnavi Naik, former Goa University student from the department of zoology.The monsoon does facilitate the upcycling process for the aquatic flora and fauna. “But the lifecycle of organisms can be affected as they have to wait for another monsoon for the same cycle,” Naik said.Aerial and other living organisms have easier access to oxygen. “The aquatic flora and fauna critically depend on dissolved oxygen. This includes hydrophytes— the floating and submerged plants like lotuses, water lilies and animals like turtles, fishes, larvae of insects, amphibians and others,” Naik said.Now, no vegetation grows, as the seed of lotuses and other plants rots under submerged conditions. “Forget birds and fishes, even locals would eat parts of lotuses like bonge,” Usgaonkar said.The native fish species in the lake are also on a decline, though for unknown reasons. “There were inzullam, gonje (like catfish), tigur, godke and even konge aplenty, but now one finds only Tilapia, an invasive species,” Usgaonkar said.Excess nutrients from agricultural and domestic run offs can lead to eutrophication in the absence of water restoration and agricultural practices, Naik said.Some evidence of eutrophication can be seen. “Presence of algal blooms and echornia (called locally as frog’s thighs) needs to be studied,” Kawlekar said.Plans are afoot to carry out biochemical testing of water with an agency. “Otherwise, even releasing the water for two years on an experimental basis would help understand the advantages of maintaining hydrological balance,” Kawlekar said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","“Forget birds and fishes, even locals would eat parts of lotuses like bonge,” Usgaonkar said.The native fish species in the lake are also on a decline, though for unknown reasons. “Otherwise, even releasing the water for two years on an experimental basis would help understand the advantages of maintaining hydrological balance,” Kawlekar said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march."

Every symbol, phrase, or questionable late-night decision permanently etched onto skin becomes an energetic portal, whether it was meant to or not. Some call it self-expression, but let’s be honest—it's basically an ancient spell, except instead of a wand, it's done with a buzzing needle and mild regret. Symbols hold power. Slap a lotus on the wrist, and suddenly, there’s a direct hotline to spiritual awakening. Get a wolf howling at the moon? Now there’s an energy field summoning the inner lone wolf (or at least an irresistible urge to buy leather jackets). The more intentional the tattoo, the stronger the energy, which explains why some people walk around radiating Main Character energy while others look like they lost a bet. Ever notice how certain tattoos mark a life shift? That’s not coincidence—that’s cosmic coding. A heartbreak tattoo invites transformation, a phoenix tattoo basically demands a glow-up, and anything done in a foreign language without double-checking the meaning is bound to summon unintentional chaos. Ancient cultures already knew the deal. Warriors, shamans, and rockstars of the past (and present) inked themselves up, not just for aesthetics but to channel strength, protection, and, in some cases, to make sure the afterlife bouncer lets them in. Whether it’s a talisman, a personal mantra, or a tiny avocado, every tattoo carries an energetic signature, shaping the future in ways science hasn't quite caught up with yet. So, is every tattoo a portal? Absolutely. Some open doorways to transformation, others just lead straight to awkward small talk with strangers who also have infinity symbols. Either way, once the ink is in, the energy is set.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk called CEO of ChatGPT maker Sam Altman 'Scam Altman'. Elon Musk called Sam Altman 'Scam Altman' quoting a video of OpenAI CEO while he was answering questions at the US Senate Judiciary subcommittee. The video has been shared on Twitter by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley handle. In the testimony dated May 16, 2023, Sam Altman says that he owns no equity in OpenAI and that he is doing this for ""love"".“Do you make a lot of money, do you?,” Altman was asked, to which he responded by saying, “No. I’m paid enough for health insurance. I have no equity in OpenAI.” Sam Altman went on to add: ""I'm doing this because I love it.""The other names that Elon Musk has called Sam Altman are “Swindler” and “Liar”.Elon Musk and Sam Altman were once partners at OpenAI and have been locked in a public dispute over OpenAI's direction for a few years now. The public spat between the two billionaires -- Sam Altman and Elon Musk -- took another turn recently when the Elon Musk-led consortium made a $97.4 billion offer to buy the non-profit entity controlling Altman’s OpenAI. No surprises here that Elon Musk leads this almost $100 billion unsolicited bid for OpenAI’s nonprofit arm.Last year, Elon Musk sued OpenAI for what he claimed became a “closed-source de facto subsidiary” of its investor Microsoft, following up in November with a preliminary injunction to stop the “market-paralyzing gorgon” OpenAI from becoming a for-profit entity.Sam Altman retaliates calling Elon Musk 'insecure and unhappy' personAltman rebuffed the bid. Mocking the offer on Twitter, he wrote: “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want”. In an interview to Bloomberg, he added that OpenAI is “not for sale” and that it is the latest of “tactics, many, many lawsuits, all sorts of other crazy stuff, now this” for the “competitor” Elon Musk to “slow us down.”Seething Altman went on to add that he doesn’t believe Musk is a “happy person” and Musk’s “whole life is from a position of insecurity — I feel for the guy.”","No surprises here that Elon Musk leads this almost $100 billion unsolicited bid for OpenAI’s nonprofit arm.Last year, Elon Musk sued OpenAI for what he claimed became a “closed-source de facto subsidiary” of its investor Microsoft, following up in November with a preliminary injunction to stop the “market-paralyzing gorgon” OpenAI from becoming a for-profit entity.Sam Altman retaliates calling Elon Musk 'insecure and unhappy' personAltman rebuffed the bid.

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk’s previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk’s stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‘want to kill me’During Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk’s actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk’s gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What’s relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you’re not invading Poland, maybe you’re not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don’t just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk’s leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk’s remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany’s history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany’s dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk’s alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan’s podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility. Whether this controversy will fade or escalate further will likely depend on Musk’s future actions and public responses.Also read | Airtel recharge plans | Jio recharge plans | BSNL recharge plans","What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.

After Conservative influencer Ashley Clair claimed the father of her five-month-old son is Elon Musk and Elon Musk did not acknowledge it despite already having a number of children from different mothers, speculations are rife over what happened and why Elon Musk did not acknowledge his 13th child. Ashley's version of the storyAshley made the claim on social media and said she had to do this because tabloid media already got to know that Elon Musk is the father of her child. Then she sued Elon Musk seeking sole custody of the child. In her lawsuit, she attached screenshots of her chats with someone whose name she saved on her phone as 'EM'. EM asked her about her wellbeing after the childbirth and also said he wanted to 'knock her up again'. In May 2023, Ashley and his then-boss Seth Dillon, the CEO of Babylon Bee, a satire website, went to meet Elon Musk at the Twitter (now X) headquarters in San Francisco for an interview. Ashley revealed the photos of meeting Elon. Soon after, according to Ashley's story, Elon Musk 'slid' into her DMs and their apparent romance began. This romance continued till she got pregnant. Elon Musk asked her to keep it a secret and kept her in a luxurious apartment with a large security detail. She said Elon Musk met with the child only once and did not even ask for his photos. She also wanted a paternity test from Elon Musk. Elon Musk's version 'Woah' and 'Yikes' are the two responses that Elon Musk has so far given in reacting to posts concerning Ashley and her son.

Elon Musk has often warned about declining populations in several Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Elon Musk even went on to say that Singapore is particularly at risk due to its falling birth rate and is almost on the verge of extinction. In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, “Singapore will go extinct in some time.” Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates. ""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates,"" wrote Vembu.In another post, Vembu made a similar observation about San Fancisco. He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks. It felt empty, particularly going from my Tenkasi village,"" wrote Vembu.

This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates.Japan suffered from this same problem in the 1980s and 90s. What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk called CEO of ChatGPT maker Sam Altman 'Scam Altman'. Elon Musk called Sam Altman 'Scam Altman' quoting a video of OpenAI CEO while he was answering questions at the US Senate Judiciary subcommittee. The video has been shared on Twitter by Tesla Owners Silicon Valley handle. In the testimony dated May 16, 2023, Sam Altman says that he owns no equity in OpenAI and that he is doing this for ""love"".“Do you make a lot of money, do you?,” Altman was asked, to which he responded by saying, “No. I’m paid enough for health insurance. I have no equity in OpenAI.” Sam Altman went on to add: ""I'm doing this because I love it.""The other names that Elon Musk has called Sam Altman are “Swindler” and “Liar”.Elon Musk and Sam Altman were once partners at OpenAI and have been locked in a public dispute over OpenAI's direction for a few years now.

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk’s previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk’s stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‘want to kill me’During Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk’s actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk’s gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What’s relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you’re not invading Poland, maybe you’re not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don’t just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk’s leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk’s remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany’s history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany’s dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk’s alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan’s podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility. Whether this controversy will fade or escalate further will likely depend on Musk’s future actions and public responses.Also read | Airtel recharge plans | Jio recharge plans | BSNL recharge plans","What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.

What Zoho CEO Sridhar Vembu wrote on ChinaAs Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates.Japan suffered from this same problem in the 1980s and 90s. What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization.

This intricate art form is not just limited to sculptures but extends to paintings, where a solidified ghee canvas is adorned with images of Lord Shiva, a unique tradition in the city's Maha Shivratri celebrations.Known as Ghee Na Kamal (the Lotus of Ghee), this tradition demands expert craftsmanship to ensure the ghee remains firm and does not melt at normal temperatures. These ghee-based creations are made from both pure and vegetable ghee. They are offered to Lord Shiva during prayers, a practice upheld by a handful of families who have preserved the art for generations. Thought to have originated around 400 years ago in the city's Shiva temples, this rare skill is slowly fading.Pure ghee from Jam Khambhaliya, used in these creations, costs around Rs 1,000 per kg, whereas the more affordable vegetable ghee is available for less than Rs 150 per kg. Interior designer Snehal Jariwala, whose family has been making Ghee Na Kamal for generations, said, ""This offering has been a sacred tradition in Surat's ancient Shiva temples for centuries. Just as milk is offered to the deity, ghee symbolises purity, an offering of our purest selves to Lord Shiva.""Jariwala's family inherited this craft from their ancestors and does not charge for making the lotus, as the ghee is donated by devotees. ""Over time, people began shaping the ghee by solidifying it,"" she added. Prabodh Patrawala, an artisan who makes ghee lotuses and paintings on request, describes the intricate process: ""We first beat the ghee by hand in a specific technique without using spoons. After a while, it thickens into the desired form, then it is warmed to a precise temperature.""Once Shivratri concludes, the ghee from these offerings is repurposed for temple lamps. It transforms into a texture unsuitable for consumption, though in some temples, small portions of it are distributed as prasad. ""We have a Shiva temple at home, and every Shivratri, we offer a Ghee Na Kamal. This tradition was started by our ancestors, and we continue to honour it,"" said Nitin Bhajiyawala, who donates a 1.25 kg Jam Khambhaliya ghee lotus every year.A Fading ArtThe process involves pouring the thickened ghee into trays or frames, where it solidifies at room temperature. Creating a small lotus takes four to five hours, while a detailed painting requires over a day. Larger pieces can take several days to complete. A handful of families still practice this art, as younger generations show little interest in learning it. ""I picked up the skill while assisting my elders. My expertise in solidifying ghee led me to be invited by the royal families of Vansada and Dharampur to craft these lotuses for them,"" said Prakash Jariwala, a zari artisan. During Shivratri, young girls from his neighbourhood join in the process, keeping the tradition alive—at least for now.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","Thought to have originated around 400 years ago in the city's Shiva temples, this rare skill is slowly fading.Pure ghee from Jam Khambhaliya, used in these creations, costs around Rs 1,000 per kg, whereas the more affordable vegetable ghee is available for less than Rs 150 per kg.

He shared that despite the success he is gaining from the show, some still believe his family name got him the opportunity.The actor, who plays Saxton Ratliff in the new season of HBO’s hit series, explained that his journey in the industry has not been easy. He revealed that he has spent over a decade taking acting classes, performing in school plays, and going through countless auditions—many of which resulted in rejection.In an interview with The Sunday Times, “I know people think I got this role just because of my dad,” Schwarzenegger said. “But they don’t see the years of training, the hours I’ve put into developing characters, or the many auditions I didn’t get. Of course, it’s frustrating. There are moments when I think, I wish I didn’t have my last name, but those feelings pass quickly.”Despite the challenges, Schwarzenegger made it clear that he appreciates the life he has. “I would never trade my life with anyone,” he added. “I’m lucky to have the family I do, and I’m grateful for the lessons and values my parents have given me.”Speaking to People magazine earlier this month, he also mentioned that he still attends weekly acting classes to improve his craft. However, he credited his father’s career for sparking his love for acting. “I used to visit my dad on set all the time,” he shared. “He would take me out of school early, and I’d watch him transform into different characters. I remember sitting on set, watching him go in as my dad and come out as Mr. Freeze. I was completely fascinated by the whole process.”Arnold Schwarzenegger, who attended the White Lotus Season 3 premiere, proudly supported his son. He even posted about it on Instagram, jokingly reacting to Patrick’s role. “I was so excited to take a break from filming to celebrate [Patrick] at The White Lotus premiere,” Arnold wrote. “What a show!

Everyone is asking if Jennifer Coolidge, the star who portrayed the favorite Tanya McQuoid, will have an unexpected return considering the new location and predominantly new cast.Unfortunately for Tanya fans, the answer is no. Her narrative came to a conclusive and dramatic end in Season 2. The season began with a doomy death, which was later established as Tanya's own untimely demise. She was involved with a set of fishy rich men, eventually resorting to taking things into her own hands in a last-ditch effort to stay alive. In a wild turn of events, Tanya murdered all on a yacht before tragically slipping and hitting her head in attempting to flee, ultimately dying. The creator of the series, Mike White, stated that Tanya's death was intended to be ironic as well as appropriate given her character progression.To everyone's surprise, Greg, the widower of Tanya, played by Jon Gries, is set to appear in the Season 3 premiere. He is not the main character for the new season, but his appearance leaves some curious questions regarding Tanya's passing. He gets a brief mention from his new young girlfriend when she is drinking at a bar. It appears Greg is on vacation at a different White Lotus resort, this time in Thailand, apparently basking in Tanya's inherited wealth.

Rick often dismissed Chelsea’s upbeat personality, and their significant 22-year age gap made their dynamic even more intriguing. However, in the second episode, a different side of their relationship was shown when they shared an intimate moment.While filming the scene, Wood felt safe and supported. She worked closely with intimacy coordinator Miriam Lucia, co-star Walton Goggins, and showrunner Mike White to ensure everyone involved was comfortable. Speaking to ELLE.com before the season’s premiere, Wood expressed her appreciation for intimacy coordinators, calling them “absolutely essential.” She explained that Lucia made the process feel natural rather than overly formal, allowing the actors to take the lead in shaping the scene.Wood revealed that she and Goggins planned their intimate scenes together, discussing their vision for how the moment should unfold. They felt it was important to show tenderness between their characters, especially since Rick was not always affectionate toward Chelsea in other parts of the show. They agreed that the scene should not feel unnecessary or overly explicit but instead convey an emotional connection.In a career first for Wood, Lucia, with White’s approval, allowed her to review the scene after filming. White assured Wood that if she was uncomfortable with anything, changes could be made, including cutting parts of the sequence. Lucia emphasized that Wood’s consent was the priority, reminding her that since it was her body on screen, she had the final say. After watching the scene, Wood decided it was important to keep it, as it highlighted a part of Chelsea and Rick’s relationship that wouldn’t have been seen otherwise.Having previously worked on Netflix’s Sex Education, Wood was no stranger to filming intimate scenes. However, she admitted that experience made her more mindful about their purpose in storytelling. She explained that earlier in her career, she would agree to scenes without questioning their necessity, but now she carefully considers whether a moment can be conveyed through subtle expressions rather than nudity.Interestingly, the intimate scenes in The White Lotus weren’t the most intimidating part of filming for Wood. She confessed that what actually made her nervous was wearing bikinis on screen, showing that even experienced actors have their own personal challenges on set.","She worked closely with intimacy coordinator Miriam Lucia, co-star Walton Goggins, and showrunner Mike White to ensure everyone involved was comfortable.

lotus, Best Team Compositions For Every Valorant Map ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/valorant/best-team-compositions-for-every-valorant-map/articleshow/118714773.cms," Mar 04, 2025, 21:24 (IST)","Image via: Riot Valorant’s strategic depth comes from experimenting with different team compositions, Valorant has a remarkable degree of strategic depth in that player experimentation changes compositions with agents crafted toward the peculiarities of each map. Understanding what compositions work in what maps can be the deciding factor on casual ranks or during serious match strategizing. Here's how to dissect some of the best team compositions for some of the most played maps in Valorant.1. Fracture: Where Aggression Meets ControlOne of the most dynamic maps among all, Fracture offers much space for aggressive plays and unique angles. When Fracture is expected to return to the competitive pick pool, this composition will presumably be a go-to choice for ranked and pro matches.Duelist: NeonController: AstraSentinel: ChamberInitiators: Breach, FadeThe Best Team Comps on EVERY MAP in Patch 9.07!With her extraordinary movement and staggering abilities, Neon excels at aggressive area control. When Breach is on Neon’s team, they generally have a great power synergy due to Breach’s utilities perfectly complementing Neon’s velocity in making quick pushes. Fade provides much-needed intel on enemy location, and Astra’s gravitational pull works well for slowing down movement through vital choke points, creating opportunities for different plays. Chamber adds a more defensive approach by creating space with his long-range duels and Trademark to deter enemy advancement. 2. Lotus: Simplicity and DominanceLotus is very much a map where simplicity can play a big role. Though compositions with Viper and two controllers can work here, the composition thus favors utilizing the most utility and control while keeping pressure onto the site.Duelist: RazeController: OmenSentinel: KilljoyInitiators: Fade, Gekko3. Pearl: Unconventional but PowerfulBecause of Pearl's rich geography and its high-value zones like B long, it is one of the maps where the offbeat compositions can excel-potent. It may look quirky at first but makes for a serious punch if the execution is right.Duelist: Neon, YoruController: AstraSentinel: ChamberInitiator: Fade50 Game Changing Valorant Tips in 10 MINUTES | Valorant Tips, Tricks, and GuidesIn fact, the most wonderful combination in Pearl could be Neon and Yoru contesting B long. In addition, they are both quite effective. Because Neon can gain such speed, and Yoru can teleport, he will control that area quickly. While fully benefiting from Astra's universal utility throughout the map, Chamber's precision and versatility seem to allow him to hold long angles or high-stakes fights. So much Fade is about intel grabbing to find enemy locations in order to assure your team has a lead on the intel game. 4. Abyss: Balanced Utility and Map ControlAbyss is indeed a neat and large map for open spaces and numerous lanes. Thus, it would require some good balance in terms of having mixed utility and defense, as it is a well-balanced combination of control, vision, and flexibility for anything.Duelist: JettController: AstraSentinel: CypherInitiators: KayO, SovaOn high-speed play and mobility, Jett can be an absolute game-changer on Abyss, especially for aggressive rotations and site pushes. Astra's smokes and gravity well manipulations are more useful in controlling certain areas of the map. Cypher provides the most map control with his tripwires and camera to discourage flanking. Kayo and Sova yield excellent utility for clearing vision while providing intel. Sova's recon darts are not at all bad in open areas, while some flashes emitted by KayO add value in constricted areas, especially during pushes or defending sites. Every agent brings into play particular strengths, and recognizing good synergies can win or lose a game. Therefore, you create compositions that optimize utility, map control, and, in general, strategic advantage by careful selection of agents that accurately complement each other. So, whenever you are drawing up your team next time, this should be borne in mind: It is not just about selecting your favorite agent; it is about the right tools for the job.","When Fracture is expected to return to the competitive pick pool, this composition will presumably be a go-to choice for ranked and pro matches.Duelist: NeonController: AstraSentinel: ChamberInitiators: Breach, FadeThe Best Team Comps on EVERY MAP in Patch 9.07!With her extraordinary movement and staggering abilities, Neon excels at aggressive area control.

The actor, known for his performances in films such as ""The Patriot"", ""Black Hawk Down"", ""The Death of Stalin"", and the ""Harry Potter"" franchise, said the trip to India was quite transformative for him. ""Hotel Mumbai"" was based on the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.""I think about transformation a lot because I'm older... And I think probably the first time I really thought a lot about it was when I worked in India. Well, they made a film called 'Hotel Mumbai'. ""We travelled around India a lot and we saw the highs and the lows and the massive wealth gap there. It does make you reflect on what material possessions mean... It's something that I think about all the time,"" Isaacs told PTI in a roundtable interview. His new show ""The White Lotus"" focuses on a group of tourists and how their lives change during the course of an ultra luxury vacation and Isaacs said he had a similar experience in Thailand where the third season of the HBO show is set. ""I made some friends but also got to see a country where people live very differently with massive disparity. We're actors, we're endlessly curious about who people are, how they are, and choices they make. And also for me, different cultures, different politics, different attitudes to life and death... So, it was a very three-dimensional experience."" ""The White Lotus"", which currently streams on JioHotstar, is created by Mike White. Each season of the show revolves around the dynamics between rich guests and employees of a fictional resort chain, called White Lotus. The first season was set in Hawaii and the second season was shot in Sicily, Italy. ""Mike chose Thailand for a reason because people go there for a spiritual odyssey as well as for all the normally entertaining things. He wanted to make the series have more resonance and he achieved it in spades,"" the 61-year-old actor said. Isaacs plays the role of Timothy Ratliff, a US-based financier, who visits the resort with his family -- wife Victoria (Parker Posey), sons Saxon (Patrick Schwarzenegger), Lochlan (Sam Nivola) and daughter Piper (Sarah Catherine Hook). While on vacation, Ratliff gets to know that his business is in serious trouble. ""I had some big acting to do. I mean, there's some extreme emotions. There's a pressure cooker which is exploding... His entire life and future. And along with all the other sex, drugs, and tofu that Mike writes about, this series has questions of identity and what is the self,"" he said about the new season. According to Isaacs, the USP of White's writing is that it can't be slotted into easy categories. ""There are no cliches here. What he does so brilliantly is that you meet the characters and you think you understand who they are. Sometimes you can even make comparisons with previous characters in the show, but he's far too sophisticated for that. ""So how does it compare? Timothy is Timothy, and there's no one like him specifically, and his particular dilemma has never been seen before,"" he added. In his long career, Isaacs has played some of the most compelling characters whether it is Lucius Malfoy from the ""Harry Potter"" movies, Colonel William Tavington in ""The Patriot"" or Georgy Zhukov in ""The Death of Stalin"". Asked about his fascination for morally complex characters, the actor said they are the most interesting parts. ""The last thing I want to do, if I get the choice, is to be in something that finishes and people go, 'That was good. What should we eat?' I'd rather have it finished and people have a discussion. The discussion starts when the credits roll. And that's what Mike Wight writes,"" he added. Season three of ""The White Lotus"" also features Leslie Bibb, Carrie Coon, Walton Goggins, Michelle Monaghan, Lek Patravadi, Lalisa Manobal, Tayme Thapthimthong and Aimee Lou Wood.

Thousands of birds and scores of birders and tourists who converged at the scenic spot have been missing in recent years.Goa’s only important bird and biodiversity area (IBA) now appears to be a better home to Indian mugger crocodilesthan waders and other avifauna. “We are not aware of any forest department study of the lake as a bird habitat. But it appears that it is being considered more as a crocodile habitat now,” said Dinesh Usgaonkar, a biodiversity management committee (BMC) member.With the lake full to the brim round the year, the crocodile population seems to have increased over the years, though theirs is a peaceful coexistence with residents on its banks.“If the lake was dry, they would have relocated elsewhere. We are not against crocodiles, but their habitat is the nearby Cumbharjua canal,” Usgaonkar said.Cumbharjua MLA Rajesh Faldesai has petitioned the forest department to relocate the reptiles to Bondla zoo due to local concerns.But forest department sources said that it is not feasible to do so. Sources said the crocodile population is more visible during the breeding season in summer and disperses subsequently.In the past, when the lake’s sluice gate would be opened around late April and closed around Aug-Sep, a whole ecological cycle of breeding and rejuvenation for aquatic flora and fauna would begin.“The water was released for the adjoining paddy field after the harvest. Once dry, the tortoise would emerge and the seed from lotuses would be embedded on lakebed for germination,” said Devanand Kawlekar, BMC chairman.Around two decades ago, an order of the high court of Bombay at Goa made the forest department the lake’s custodian. Sometime later, the sluice gate was shut, triggering the lake’s slow ecological degradation.“In the past, its ecosystem was vibrant with hundreds of lotuses and other aquatic biodiversity. During rains, paddy cultivation was done in the lake (Tollem) followed by storing of water for rabi crops after harvest,” said Kawlekar, an ecologist.Carambolim lake was a hotspot for birders even before the railway station was set up in part of its area. In the lake’s glory days, birders, including Heinz Lanier, had reported waders in thousands.Birding as an activity was pioneered here and Goa Bird Conservation Network and other birders have reported 306 bird species in Carambolim lake including nearby Dhado wetland complex.“When the lake was emptied, the birds fed on worms and molluscs, but now hardly any vegetation grows in it,” Kawlekar said.The forest department has created islands in the lake for birds. “But if there is no food, birds will not come,” he added.The traditional practice of releasing water helped the lake’s ecosystem and paddy cultivation.“Releasing water is crucial in maintaining hydrological balance as the inflow of water helps recharge, maintain clarity of water and enable regular supply of oxygen to the lake’s ecosystem,” said Vaishnavi Naik, former Goa University student from the department of zoology.The monsoon does facilitate the upcycling process for the aquatic flora and fauna. “But the lifecycle of organisms can be affected as they have to wait for another monsoon for the same cycle,” Naik said.Aerial and other living organisms have easier access to oxygen. “The aquatic flora and fauna critically depend on dissolved oxygen. This includes hydrophytes— the floating and submerged plants like lotuses, water lilies and animals like turtles, fishes, larvae of insects, amphibians and others,” Naik said.Now, no vegetation grows, as the seed of lotuses and other plants rots under submerged conditions. “Forget birds and fishes, even locals would eat parts of lotuses like bonge,” Usgaonkar said.The native fish species in the lake are also on a decline, though for unknown reasons. “There were inzullam, gonje (like catfish), tigur, godke and even konge aplenty, but now one finds only Tilapia, an invasive species,” Usgaonkar said.Excess nutrients from agricultural and domestic run offs can lead to eutrophication in the absence of water restoration and agricultural practices, Naik said.Some evidence of eutrophication can be seen. “Presence of algal blooms and echornia (called locally as frog’s thighs) needs to be studied,” Kawlekar said.Plans are afoot to carry out biochemical testing of water with an agency. “Otherwise, even releasing the water for two years on an experimental basis would help understand the advantages of maintaining hydrological balance,” Kawlekar said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","“Forget birds and fishes, even locals would eat parts of lotuses like bonge,” Usgaonkar said.The native fish species in the lake are also on a decline, though for unknown reasons. “Otherwise, even releasing the water for two years on an experimental basis would help understand the advantages of maintaining hydrological balance,” Kawlekar said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march."

Every symbol, phrase, or questionable late-night decision permanently etched onto skin becomes an energetic portal, whether it was meant to or not. Some call it self-expression, but let’s be honest—it's basically an ancient spell, except instead of a wand, it's done with a buzzing needle and mild regret. Symbols hold power. Slap a lotus on the wrist, and suddenly, there’s a direct hotline to spiritual awakening. Get a wolf howling at the moon? Now there’s an energy field summoning the inner lone wolf (or at least an irresistible urge to buy leather jackets). The more intentional the tattoo, the stronger the energy, which explains why some people walk around radiating Main Character energy while others look like they lost a bet. Ever notice how certain tattoos mark a life shift? That’s not coincidence—that’s cosmic coding. A heartbreak tattoo invites transformation, a phoenix tattoo basically demands a glow-up, and anything done in a foreign language without double-checking the meaning is bound to summon unintentional chaos. Ancient cultures already knew the deal. Warriors, shamans, and rockstars of the past (and present) inked themselves up, not just for aesthetics but to channel strength, protection, and, in some cases, to make sure the afterlife bouncer lets them in. Whether it’s a talisman, a personal mantra, or a tiny avocado, every tattoo carries an energetic signature, shaping the future in ways science hasn't quite caught up with yet. So, is every tattoo a portal? Absolutely. Some open doorways to transformation, others just lead straight to awkward small talk with strangers who also have infinity symbols. Either way, once the ink is in, the energy is set.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received.

WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan.

The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record.

The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect.

Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence.

Earlier, Gujarat CM Narenra Modi too had raised a similar demand. As per the provisions in the bill, two-thirds of the country's population will be legally entitled to receive subsidized foodgrain after enactment of the law.While each person will receive 5 kg of foodgrain per month with rice, wheat or coarse grains at Rs 3, Rs 2 and Re 1 per kg respectively, the poorest of the poor will get 35 kg foodgrain per household per month under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana. According to estimates, states like UP, Bihar and Rajasthan will see substantial increase in their annual foodgrain allocation. The government has also amended the scheme to take care of concerns of states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. The differential quantity of grains will go to states at the rate prescribed for people living above poverty line (APL). In a written reply in Rajya Sabha last week, food minister K V Thomas had said that in Bihar, 85.12% of rural population and 74.5% of urban population will be covered under this scheme. Similarly, in Uttar Pradesh, 79.5% people in rural areas and 64.43% of urban population will be covered. Meanwhile, following Mulayam's demand to protect the interests of farmers, the government has said that to meet the increased requirement of foodgrain for implementation of the scheme, procurement will be further extended. It claimed that more farmers will get the benefit of minimum support price. After amendments, the foodgrain requirement for the scheme is estimated at 614.3 lakh tonnes as against the existing requirement of 563.7 lakh tonnes for the public distribution system.","According to estimates, states like UP, Bihar and Rajasthan will see substantial increase in their annual foodgrain allocation.

According to sources, the workers will interact with family members of each household and ask them 20 questions from a ‘sankalp patra’.The responses will be collected, analyzed and inferences will be drawn to help the party prepare its manifesto for the polls. Talking about the questions in the ‘sankalp patra’, All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary and incharge of Western UP, Naseeb Singh, said, “During our visit to Dalit families, we will ask them what they have got from Mayawati though she considers them her vote-bank. We will also ask if they have gained anything from the BSP chief erecting huge memorials for Dalit icons. Or how much money she gave them from the huge property she has amassed.” The other questions in the ‘sankalp patra’ will target other political parties. Minorities will be asked why they sufer riots though certain parties act as their well-wishers. Reactions of general public will be taken to know if they want only Mulayam Singh Yadav’s family members to rule the state. People will also be queried on how many promises the Narenra Modi government in the centre has fulfilled so far. “We will ask public, including farmers and labourers, on what their expectations are from the government and their demands that have not yet been met by the previous governments in the past 27 years. On the basis of their responses, we will make our own sankalp (promises) to fulfil them once Congress comes to power in the state,” Singh said. He added that the demands of people will be part of the party’s manifesto for the UP assembly polls. During the door-to-door campaign, Congress party workers will also note down the mobile numbers of family members to remain in touch with them. They will also paste the party’s sticker outside the houses. “Our target of covering 50,000 families in each of 403 assembly seats will strengthen the bond of Congress with the public.

Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narenra Modi and successful leadership of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, this budget is a concrete step in the direction of realising happiness, progress and prosperity in the daily lives of 25 crore residents of the state,” he added. President of Eastern UP Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Vinay Tandon said the budget of about Rs 700,000 crore of the state government (which has about 600,000 crore of revenue received through taxes) shows that the business in the present government is moving in the right direction. Agriculture also has an important contribution and government has rightly given a lot of attention to infrastructure and agriculture.“Recently in the Global Investors Summit, the government has signed MoU’s worth Rs 35.5 lakh crore and this will contribute significantly to the progress of the state. For ODOP goods, the government has suggested opening a mall for which a provision of Rs 200 crores has been made, which is a welcome news,” he said. There is a proposal of constructing an industrial complex at six places in Bundelkhand and along Purvanchal Expressway, which is commendable, he added. Commenting on the budget, former professor at the department of economics and present head at NITI Aayog chair at Allahabad University, prof Man Mohan Krishna said the allocation of Rs 2500 crore for the Maha kumbh-2025 would expedite the proposed projects and will result in giving the city several permanent structures thereby developing the city. “When there is development, more and more people get employment,” he added. Senior Congress leader and former UPCC spokesman Kishore Varshney termed mega budget ‘disappointing’. “The budget is an attempt to deceive the common people and prepared only keeping the 2024 polls in mind. Government had neither taken any substantial step to create additional employment nor did anything for education, social welfare and women etc. Though budget allocated funds for various programmes, implementation of none seems to be possible on the ground.” “42% of water does not reach canals due to which farmers couldn’t get any benefit for fertilizers and seeds.

Rauch noted that this year's egg-laying had been delayed, attributing it partly to the cold winter weather.At 8 years, Lotus is much younger than Mr. President, aged approximately 16-17, approaching the typical 20-year lifespan of bald eagles.Mr. President and First LadyMr. President, also known as Mr. P, initially paired with First Lady in December 2013, and produced eight eaglets. However, the eighth offspring succumbed to West Nile virus in 2018.Mr. P and First Lady's first eaglet was born in 2014.Mr. P, and First Lady built a nest near the arboretum’s azalea garden, the first such instance for a bald eagle couple at the property in 68 years. A 24/7 live feed from a web camera in a tree near the nest made the pair popular.The pair's relationship deteriorated due to breeding difficulties. Additionally, First Lady's seasonal absences led to Mr. P entertaining other potential mates, resulting in dramatic aerial confrontations. Despite reconciliation attempts, First Lady left permanently on Valentine's Day 2022, and Lotus came in the next day.Bald eagles typically maintain lifelong partnerships when breeding successfully, but could seek new mates if reproduction fails.Also, eagles relocate their nests for various reasons, including predator presence, tree health, or structural concerns.Mr. President and LotusLotus (short for Lady Of The United States) first became a mom in 2022. Its nest with Mr. P and their eaglets is in a more secluded, wooded area of the arboretum. Experts decided not to install a camera at the new nest, which overlooks the golf course, about a mile as the eagle flies, from the old nest.Number of active bald eagle nests in D.C. area at decades-high markThere were as many as 26 active bald eagle nests last year in the D.C. area last year, reaching a decades-high mark.The population growth stems from pesticide restrictions and the 1970s Endangered Species Act, alongside habitat improvements and environmental initiatives. Though removed from endangered status in 2007, bald eagles remain federally protected. The Lower 48 states now host 71,000 breeding pairs, up significantly from under 500 in the 1960s, according to US Fish and Wildlife Service data.""It's pretty impressive. It shows bald eagles have really come back to the area strong,"" Rauch, the wildlife biologist, said.In December 2024, then-US President Joe Biden officially designated the bald eagle as the national bird.","Despite reconciliation attempts, First Lady left permanently on Valentine's Day 2022, and Lotus came in the next day.Bald eagles typically maintain lifelong partnerships when breeding successfully, but could seek new mates if reproduction fails.Also, eagles relocate their nests for various reasons, including predator presence, tree health, or structural concerns.Mr. Its nest with Mr. P and their eaglets is in a more secluded, wooded area of the arboretum."

This intricate art form is not just limited to sculptures but extends to paintings, where a solidified ghee canvas is adorned with images of Lord Shiva, a unique tradition in the city's Maha Shivratri celebrations.Known as Ghee Na Kamal (the Lotus of Ghee), this tradition demands expert craftsmanship to ensure the ghee remains firm and does not melt at normal temperatures. These ghee-based creations are made from both pure and vegetable ghee. They are offered to Lord Shiva during prayers, a practice upheld by a handful of families who have preserved the art for generations. Thought to have originated around 400 years ago in the city's Shiva temples, this rare skill is slowly fading.Pure ghee from Jam Khambhaliya, used in these creations, costs around Rs 1,000 per kg, whereas the more affordable vegetable ghee is available for less than Rs 150 per kg. Interior designer Snehal Jariwala, whose family has been making Ghee Na Kamal for generations, said, ""This offering has been a sacred tradition in Surat's ancient Shiva temples for centuries. Just as milk is offered to the deity, ghee symbolises purity, an offering of our purest selves to Lord Shiva.""Jariwala's family inherited this craft from their ancestors and does not charge for making the lotus, as the ghee is donated by devotees. ""Over time, people began shaping the ghee by solidifying it,"" she added. Prabodh Patrawala, an artisan who makes ghee lotuses and paintings on request, describes the intricate process: ""We first beat the ghee by hand in a specific technique without using spoons. After a while, it thickens into the desired form, then it is warmed to a precise temperature.""Once Shivratri concludes, the ghee from these offerings is repurposed for temple lamps. It transforms into a texture unsuitable for consumption, though in some temples, small portions of it are distributed as prasad. ""We have a Shiva temple at home, and every Shivratri, we offer a Ghee Na Kamal. This tradition was started by our ancestors, and we continue to honour it,"" said Nitin Bhajiyawala, who donates a 1.25 kg Jam Khambhaliya ghee lotus every year.A Fading ArtThe process involves pouring the thickened ghee into trays or frames, where it solidifies at room temperature. Creating a small lotus takes four to five hours, while a detailed painting requires over a day. Larger pieces can take several days to complete. A handful of families still practice this art, as younger generations show little interest in learning it. ""I picked up the skill while assisting my elders. My expertise in solidifying ghee led me to be invited by the royal families of Vansada and Dharampur to craft these lotuses for them,"" said Prakash Jariwala, a zari artisan. During Shivratri, young girls from his neighbourhood join in the process, keeping the tradition alive—at least for now.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","Thought to have originated around 400 years ago in the city's Shiva temples, this rare skill is slowly fading.Pure ghee from Jam Khambhaliya, used in these creations, costs around Rs 1,000 per kg, whereas the more affordable vegetable ghee is available for less than Rs 150 per kg.

lotus, Best Team Compositions For Every Valorant Map ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/valorant/best-team-compositions-for-every-valorant-map/articleshow/118714773.cms," Mar 04, 2025, 21:24 (IST)","Image via: Riot Valorant’s strategic depth comes from experimenting with different team compositions, Valorant has a remarkable degree of strategic depth in that player experimentation changes compositions with agents crafted toward the peculiarities of each map. Understanding what compositions work in what maps can be the deciding factor on casual ranks or during serious match strategizing. Here's how to dissect some of the best team compositions for some of the most played maps in Valorant.1. Fracture: Where Aggression Meets ControlOne of the most dynamic maps among all, Fracture offers much space for aggressive plays and unique angles. When Fracture is expected to return to the competitive pick pool, this composition will presumably be a go-to choice for ranked and pro matches.Duelist: NeonController: AstraSentinel: ChamberInitiators: Breach, FadeThe Best Team Comps on EVERY MAP in Patch 9.07!With her extraordinary movement and staggering abilities, Neon excels at aggressive area control. When Breach is on Neon’s team, they generally have a great power synergy due to Breach’s utilities perfectly complementing Neon’s velocity in making quick pushes. Fade provides much-needed intel on enemy location, and Astra’s gravitational pull works well for slowing down movement through vital choke points, creating opportunities for different plays. Chamber adds a more defensive approach by creating space with his long-range duels and Trademark to deter enemy advancement. 2. Lotus: Simplicity and DominanceLotus is very much a map where simplicity can play a big role. Though compositions with Viper and two controllers can work here, the composition thus favors utilizing the most utility and control while keeping pressure onto the site.Duelist: RazeController: OmenSentinel: KilljoyInitiators: Fade, Gekko3. Pearl: Unconventional but PowerfulBecause of Pearl's rich geography and its high-value zones like B long, it is one of the maps where the offbeat compositions can excel-potent. It may look quirky at first but makes for a serious punch if the execution is right.Duelist: Neon, YoruController: AstraSentinel: ChamberInitiator: Fade50 Game Changing Valorant Tips in 10 MINUTES | Valorant Tips, Tricks, and GuidesIn fact, the most wonderful combination in Pearl could be Neon and Yoru contesting B long. In addition, they are both quite effective. Because Neon can gain such speed, and Yoru can teleport, he will control that area quickly. While fully benefiting from Astra's universal utility throughout the map, Chamber's precision and versatility seem to allow him to hold long angles or high-stakes fights. So much Fade is about intel grabbing to find enemy locations in order to assure your team has a lead on the intel game. 4. Abyss: Balanced Utility and Map ControlAbyss is indeed a neat and large map for open spaces and numerous lanes. Thus, it would require some good balance in terms of having mixed utility and defense, as it is a well-balanced combination of control, vision, and flexibility for anything.Duelist: JettController: AstraSentinel: CypherInitiators: KayO, SovaOn high-speed play and mobility, Jett can be an absolute game-changer on Abyss, especially for aggressive rotations and site pushes. Astra's smokes and gravity well manipulations are more useful in controlling certain areas of the map. Cypher provides the most map control with his tripwires and camera to discourage flanking. Kayo and Sova yield excellent utility for clearing vision while providing intel. Sova's recon darts are not at all bad in open areas, while some flashes emitted by KayO add value in constricted areas, especially during pushes or defending sites. Every agent brings into play particular strengths, and recognizing good synergies can win or lose a game. Therefore, you create compositions that optimize utility, map control, and, in general, strategic advantage by careful selection of agents that accurately complement each other. So, whenever you are drawing up your team next time, this should be borne in mind: It is not just about selecting your favorite agent; it is about the right tools for the job.","When Fracture is expected to return to the competitive pick pool, this composition will presumably be a go-to choice for ranked and pro matches.Duelist: NeonController: AstraSentinel: ChamberInitiators: Breach, FadeThe Best Team Comps on EVERY MAP in Patch 9.07!With her extraordinary movement and staggering abilities, Neon excels at aggressive area control.

Everyone is asking if Jennifer Coolidge, the star who portrayed the favorite Tanya McQuoid, will have an unexpected return considering the new location and predominantly new cast.Unfortunately for Tanya fans, the answer is no. Her narrative came to a conclusive and dramatic end in Season 2. The season began with a doomy death, which was later established as Tanya's own untimely demise. She was involved with a set of fishy rich men, eventually resorting to taking things into her own hands in a last-ditch effort to stay alive.

Rick often dismissed Chelsea’s upbeat personality, and their significant 22-year age gap made their dynamic even more intriguing. However, in the second episode, a different side of their relationship was shown when they shared an intimate moment.While filming the scene, Wood felt safe and supported. She worked closely with intimacy coordinator Miriam Lucia, co-star Walton Goggins, and showrunner Mike White to ensure everyone involved was comfortable. Speaking to ELLE.com before the season’s premiere, Wood expressed her appreciation for intimacy coordinators, calling them “absolutely essential.” She explained that Lucia made the process feel natural rather than overly formal, allowing the actors to take the lead in shaping the scene.Wood revealed that she and Goggins planned their intimate scenes together, discussing their vision for how the moment should unfold. They felt it was important to show tenderness between their characters, especially since Rick was not always affectionate toward Chelsea in other parts of the show. They agreed that the scene should not feel unnecessary or overly explicit but instead convey an emotional connection.In a career first for Wood, Lucia, with White’s approval, allowed her to review the scene after filming. White assured Wood that if she was uncomfortable with anything, changes could be made, including cutting parts of the sequence. Lucia emphasized that Wood’s consent was the priority, reminding her that since it was her body on screen, she had the final say. After watching the scene, Wood decided it was important to keep it, as it highlighted a part of Chelsea and Rick’s relationship that wouldn’t have been seen otherwise.Having previously worked on Netflix’s Sex Education, Wood was no stranger to filming intimate scenes. However, she admitted that experience made her more mindful about their purpose in storytelling. She explained that earlier in her career, she would agree to scenes without questioning their necessity, but now she carefully considers whether a moment can be conveyed through subtle expressions rather than nudity.Interestingly, the intimate scenes in The White Lotus weren’t the most intimidating part of filming for Wood. She confessed that what actually made her nervous was wearing bikinis on screen, showing that even experienced actors have their own personal challenges on set.","She worked closely with intimacy coordinator Miriam Lucia, co-star Walton Goggins, and showrunner Mike White to ensure everyone involved was comfortable.

Namita Sharma — the 44-year-old founder of Saksham Helping Hands NGO — has become the creative force behind the city's revolutionary ‘Waste to Wonder' parks.Growing up in a middle-class household, Namita learnt early that every discarded item held potential. ""My mother's philosophy was simple – nothing goes to waste. Those early lessons in resourcefulness shaped my perspective on what others might consider trash,"" she says.Namita's philosophy has now manifested into three such public spaces. The first park, unveiled at Company Bagh in Naya Ganj in 2023, set the stage for what would become a city-wide movement. Subsequent installations at Raj Nagar in Dec last year and at Meerut Road Trisection this Feb have further cemented her reputation as a ""waste artist"".The numbers tell an impressive story. More than 1.2 tonnes of iron scrap, 550kg of plastic waste, 10,000 plastic bottles, 235 old tyres, and 45kg of discarded clothing have breathed new life into Company Bagh alone. Namita's creations range from lotus flowers blooming from old tyres to musical instruments fashioned from water tanks and metal scraps, illuminated by colourful lights that transform these intersections.At the park in Meerut Road trisection, her latest masterpiece features a magnificent 1.5-tonne veena crafted from salvaged materials, standing as the centrepiece among installations created from eight tonnes of iron scrap, 10 plastic water tanks, and 400 old tyres. ""These aren't just installations, they're narratives in metal and plastic. Each piece tells a story of transformation, challenging viewers to reconsider their definition of waste,"" she says.Namita's initiative is part of the Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation's ‘Waste to Best' campaign.

Every symbol, phrase, or questionable late-night decision permanently etched onto skin becomes an energetic portal, whether it was meant to or not. Some call it self-expression, but let’s be honest—it's basically an ancient spell, except instead of a wand, it's done with a buzzing needle and mild regret. Symbols hold power. Slap a lotus on the wrist, and suddenly, there’s a direct hotline to spiritual awakening. Get a wolf howling at the moon? Now there’s an energy field summoning the inner lone wolf (or at least an irresistible urge to buy leather jackets). The more intentional the tattoo, the stronger the energy, which explains why some people walk around radiating Main Character energy while others look like they lost a bet. Ever notice how certain tattoos mark a life shift? That’s not coincidence—that’s cosmic coding. A heartbreak tattoo invites transformation, a phoenix tattoo basically demands a glow-up, and anything done in a foreign language without double-checking the meaning is bound to summon unintentional chaos. Ancient cultures already knew the deal. Warriors, shamans, and rockstars of the past (and present) inked themselves up, not just for aesthetics but to channel strength, protection, and, in some cases, to make sure the afterlife bouncer lets them in. Whether it’s a talisman, a personal mantra, or a tiny avocado, every tattoo carries an energetic signature, shaping the future in ways science hasn't quite caught up with yet. So, is every tattoo a portal? Absolutely. Some open doorways to transformation, others just lead straight to awkward small talk with strangers who also have infinity symbols. Either way, once the ink is in, the energy is set.

Confusion over signboards at interchange entry points or exits has left drivers, especially non-English speaking cabbies, struggling to navigate the high-speed, signal-free stretch. While GPS offers a safety net to some, others say signages at the end of interchange arms leads to missed exits and potential hazards.One motorist summed it up saying, ""The signboards only confirm whether you're on the right or wrong road—by the time you see them, it's too late to change course. They should be placed at decision points, not when you've already committed to a route."" Some motorists suggest that signboards should be placed well before actual exits and be illuminated for better visibility. Others believe that markings on the road itself could help drivers anticipate turns in time, making the commute safer and more seamless.In June last year a few months after the signal-free road opened, there was confusion among motorists on the signboards put up at the exit near Haji Ali, which directed motorists towards either Barrister Rajni Patel junction or Vatsala Bai Desai junction. Both road names did not seem familiar to motorists. Taking note of such concerns, BMC added a new signboard below the existing ones showing a right turn towards Haji Ali junction and left towards Worli naka and Mumbai airport.Some motorists have said for a person using the road for the first time or not very frequently there are still a few hiccups. For instance, a motorist pointed out, ""If you're coming from south Mumbai and need to exit at Worli, you must take the Sea Link diversion. If you mistakenly take Worli naka, you end up at Lotus Court instead. The Sea Link diversion leads to Worli, Prabhadevi, and the actual Sea Link.""When asked, the BMC, however, dismissed concerns about inadequate signage. ""Signboards are placed at intersections, immediately after turns, before ramps, and on gantries opposite Worli Dairy,"" said a senior official.Since the Coastal Road's opening on March 12, 2024, and up to Dec 31, 2024, 5 million vehicles have used it, said BMC, with an average of 18,000-20,000 vehicles daily. 24x7 access to the road is still awaited.

His involvement with OpenAI dates back to its inception, though he parted ways with its board in 2018.

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk’s previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk’s stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‘want to kill me’During Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk’s actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk’s gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What’s relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you’re not invading Poland, maybe you’re not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don’t just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk’s leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk’s remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany’s history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany’s dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk’s alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan’s podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility. Whether this controversy will fade or escalate further will likely depend on Musk’s future actions and public responses.Also read | Airtel recharge plans | Jio recharge plans | BSNL recharge plans","What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.

So says a petition signed by more than 250,000 Canadian citizens and residents. The parliamentary petition urges Canada to revoke Elon Musk’s citizenship and passport. The petition, which opened to signatures late last week, accuses Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty.

Trump has also proposed annexing the country as the 51st state, is “against the national interest of Canada,” the petitioners claim.“He has used his wealth and power to influence our elections,” the petition claims. “He has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty.” Responding to the news about the petition, shared by a Twitter user, Elon Musk wrote: “Canada is not a real country.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk, however, later deleted the post. It is not certain why he deleted the post, considering he has been quite vocal about his opinion on a range of issues even if it is opposed by many. The petition is addressed to Justin Trudeau and sponsored by Charlie Angus, a member of Parliament for the left-of-center New Democratic Party. A petition, initiated on February 20 and currently supported by over 250,000 Canadian signatures, will remain available for signatures until June 20.Meanwhile, Musk's daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson, said in a post on Threads, ""I’m ngl this Canadian ’51st state’ s**t has upped my Canadian patriotism by about 5000000%”.How Elon Musk is a Canadian citizenBorn in Pretoria, South Africa, Elon Musk holds both Canadian and US citizenship.

Elon Musk has often warned about declining populations in several Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Elon Musk even went on to say that Singapore is particularly at risk due to its falling birth rate and is almost on the verge of extinction. In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, “Singapore will go extinct in some time.” Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates. ""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates,"" wrote Vembu.In another post, Vembu made a similar observation about San Fancisco. He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks.

This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates.Japan suffered from this same problem in the 1980s and 90s. What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization.

His involvement with OpenAI dates back to its inception, though he parted ways with its board in 2018.

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk’s previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk’s stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‘want to kill me’During Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk’s actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk’s gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What’s relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you’re not invading Poland, maybe you’re not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don’t just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk’s leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk’s remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany’s history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany’s dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk’s alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan’s podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility. Whether this controversy will fade or escalate further will likely depend on Musk’s future actions and public responses.Also read | Airtel recharge plans | Jio recharge plans | BSNL recharge plans","What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.

After Conservative influencer Ashley Clair claimed the father of her five-month-old son is Elon Musk and Elon Musk did not acknowledge it despite already having a number of children from different mothers, speculations are rife over what happened and why Elon Musk did not acknowledge his 13th child. Ashley's version of the storyAshley made the claim on social media and said she had to do this because tabloid media already got to know that Elon Musk is the father of her child. Then she sued Elon Musk seeking sole custody of the child. In her lawsuit, she attached screenshots of her chats with someone whose name she saved on her phone as 'EM'. EM asked her about her wellbeing after the childbirth and also said he wanted to 'knock her up again'. In May 2023, Ashley and his then-boss Seth Dillon, the CEO of Babylon Bee, a satire website, went to meet Elon Musk at the Twitter (now X) headquarters in San Francisco for an interview.

So says a petition signed by more than 250,000 Canadian citizens and residents. The parliamentary petition urges Canada to revoke Elon Musk’s citizenship and passport. The petition, which opened to signatures late last week, accuses Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty. Elon Musk is one of the closest associates of the US President Donald Trump, who plans to levy a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports next month. Trump has also proposed annexing the country as the 51st state, is “against the national interest of Canada,” the petitioners claim.“He has used his wealth and power to influence our elections,” the petition claims. “He has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty.” Responding to the news about the petition, shared by a Twitter user, Elon Musk wrote: “Canada is not a real country.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk, however, later deleted the post. It is not certain why he deleted the post, considering he has been quite vocal about his opinion on a range of issues even if it is opposed by many. The petition is addressed to Justin Trudeau and sponsored by Charlie Angus, a member of Parliament for the left-of-center New Democratic Party. A petition, initiated on February 20 and currently supported by over 250,000 Canadian signatures, will remain available for signatures until June 20.Meanwhile, Musk's daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson, said in a post on Threads, ""I’m ngl this Canadian ’51st state’ s**t has upped my Canadian patriotism by about 5000000%”.How Elon Musk is a Canadian citizenBorn in Pretoria, South Africa, Elon Musk holds both Canadian and US citizenship.

Elon Musk has often warned about declining populations in several Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Elon Musk even went on to say that Singapore is particularly at risk due to its falling birth rate and is almost on the verge of extinction. In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, “Singapore will go extinct in some time.” Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates. ""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates,"" wrote Vembu.In another post, Vembu made a similar observation about San Fancisco. He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks.

What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization.

Elon Musk reportedly exclusively confirmed the news to Page Six. “As for ‘secretly fathered,’ that is … false. All our friends and family know.

Seldon is believed to be the Tesla CEO's 14th child, as he is yet to respond to Ashley St. Clair’s claims. The 26-year-old conservative activist recently filed a paternity lawsuit against the SpaceX CEO in which she asked for sole custody of her 5-month-old son.According to a report in Page Six, Ashley included in her complaint a photo she had sent to Elon Musk that showed her holding her baby boy at the hospital, to which he allegedly replied, “I look forward to seeing you and him this weekend.”Elon Musk has been a strong supporter of big families. He has time and again warned of decreasing fertility rates. “Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis. A collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilization faces by far,” Musk wrote on X in 2022.","Failure to issue a press release, which would be bizarre, does not mean ‘secret,'” Elon Musk told the publication.

""Grok is a word from a Heinlein novel, Stranger in a Strange Land, and it's used by a guy who's raised on Mars.""For those unaware, Elon Musk founded xAI in 2023 as a counter to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Musk has openly criticized the OpenAI's shift toward a for-profit structure. Elon Musk has filed two lawsuits against OpenAI, alleging it has deviated from its original mission. His involvement with OpenAI dates back to its inception, though he parted ways with its board in 2018. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman dismissed Musk’s buyout attempt as a ploy to hinder their progress.Elon Musk also spoke about the Grok app in his recent podcast with the Youtuber Joe Rogan. The duo used 'Grok Unhinged Mode' In the podcast, Elon Musk asks: ""what is there in Fort Knox?"" They follow with another similar question: ""Do you think all the Gold is there in Fort Knox?"" In answer, the AI chatbot is seen kinda evading the sensitive question. As to those unaware what Fort Knox is? Fort Knox is the most famous repository for Gold in the US. Other than Fort Know, vast quantities of Gold are also reported to be held at mints in West Point, Denver and at the Federal Reserve vault in New York.Coming to the latest on Grok, Elon Musk's xAI recently unveiled an enhanced version of its Grok-3 chatbot. This launch comes shortly after OpenAI rejected Elon Musk's $97.4 billion offer to acquire its nonprofit division. During a livestream, xAI claimed that Grok-3 surpasses OpenAI’s GPT-4o, Google’s Gemini, DeepSeek’s V3, and Anthropic’s Claude across various math, science, and coding benchmarks. Musk highlighted that Grok-3 boasts over ten times the computational power of its predecessor, with pre-training finalized in early January.These performance claims, yet to be independently verified, heat up the rivalry between xAI and OpenAI.

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk’s previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk’s stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‘want to kill me’During Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk’s actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk’s gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What’s relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you’re not invading Poland, maybe you’re not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don’t just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk’s leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk’s remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany’s history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany’s dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk’s alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan’s podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility. Whether this controversy will fade or escalate further will likely depend on Musk’s future actions and public responses.Also read | Airtel recharge plans | Jio recharge plans | BSNL recharge plans","What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.

After Conservative influencer Ashley Clair claimed the father of her five-month-old son is Elon Musk and Elon Musk did not acknowledge it despite already having a number of children from different mothers, speculations are rife over what happened and why Elon Musk did not acknowledge his 13th child. Ashley's version of the storyAshley made the claim on social media and said she had to do this because tabloid media already got to know that Elon Musk is the father of her child. Then she sued Elon Musk seeking sole custody of the child. In her lawsuit, she attached screenshots of her chats with someone whose name she saved on her phone as 'EM'. EM asked her about her wellbeing after the childbirth and also said he wanted to 'knock her up again'. In May 2023, Ashley and his then-boss Seth Dillon, the CEO of Babylon Bee, a satire website, went to meet Elon Musk at the Twitter (now X) headquarters in San Francisco for an interview. Ashley revealed the photos of meeting Elon. Soon after, according to Ashley's story, Elon Musk 'slid' into her DMs and their apparent romance began. This romance continued till she got pregnant. Elon Musk asked her to keep it a secret and kept her in a luxurious apartment with a large security detail. She said Elon Musk met with the child only once and did not even ask for his photos. She also wanted a paternity test from Elon Musk. Elon Musk's version 'Woah' and 'Yikes' are the two responses that Elon Musk has so far given in reacting to posts concerning Ashley and her son. Conspiracy theoriesInfluencer Isabella Moody claimed Ashley planned to trap Elon Musk with a baby. In support of her theory, she produced some purported chat screenshots in which Ashley apparently gushed that Elon Musk followed her on social media. ""I need his rocket babies,"" one of the chats said.Elon supporters are saying if Ashley wants privacy for her and her children, then why did she go public with her chats unless her real intention is to trap Elon Musk?Laura Loomer, a known conspiracy theorist, said she feels that Ashley's target is to harm President Trump.Why is Elon Musk not acknowledging his 13th son?Elon Musk is a pro-natalist and he has a legion of children from different women.

So says a petition signed by more than 250,000 Canadian citizens and residents. The parliamentary petition urges Canada to revoke Elon Musk’s citizenship and passport. The petition, which opened to signatures late last week, accuses Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty. Elon Musk is one of the closest associates of the US President Donald Trump, who plans to levy a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports next month. Trump has also proposed annexing the country as the 51st state, is “against the national interest of Canada,” the petitioners claim.“He has used his wealth and power to influence our elections,” the petition claims. “He has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty.” Responding to the news about the petition, shared by a Twitter user, Elon Musk wrote: “Canada is not a real country.”Tesla CEO Elon Musk, however, later deleted the post. It is not certain why he deleted the post, considering he has been quite vocal about his opinion on a range of issues even if it is opposed by many. The petition is addressed to Justin Trudeau and sponsored by Charlie Angus, a member of Parliament for the left-of-center New Democratic Party. A petition, initiated on February 20 and currently supported by over 250,000 Canadian signatures, will remain available for signatures until June 20.Meanwhile, Musk's daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson, said in a post on Threads, ""I’m ngl this Canadian ’51st state’ s**t has upped my Canadian patriotism by about 5000000%”.How Elon Musk is a Canadian citizenBorn in Pretoria, South Africa, Elon Musk holds both Canadian and US citizenship.

Elon Musk has often warned about declining populations in several Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Elon Musk even went on to say that Singapore is particularly at risk due to its falling birth rate and is almost on the verge of extinction. In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, “Singapore will go extinct in some time.” Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates. ""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates,"" wrote Vembu.In another post, Vembu made a similar observation about San Fancisco. He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks. It felt empty, particularly going from my Tenkasi village,"" wrote Vembu.

Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates.Japan suffered from this same problem in the 1980s and 90s. What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization.

There is also an orangutan in the centre. He also fed a giraffe and a rhino calf, and even spent time with elephants in their hydrotherapy pools.Some other notable residents of Vantara include a two-headed snake, a two-headed turtle, a tapir, giant otters, seals, and rescued leopard cubs, among others.","‘Vantara’, India’s largest animal rescue, conservation, and rehabilitation centre in Jamnagar, Gujarat was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday which also happens to be the World Wildlife Day.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony. ""When we awaken, we realise that the distance between Kashi and Kashan is merely half a step,"" he said.Stay updated with breaking news, weather updates, bank holidays and upcoming public holidays in march.","""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said.

Sajjan Jindal made the statement commending India's Tata and Mahindra Group at the recent Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year awards.Speaking during a panel discussion at the awards ceremony, Jindal said that it is not likely to be a cake walk for Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to chart a success story in India. “Elon Musk is not here. He is in the US,"" he said. “We Indians are here. He cannot produce what Mahindra can do, what Tata can do – it’s not possible. He can do (it) under Trump’s shadow, in the US.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million. It is anticipated that the central government's plan to develop 50 tourist attractions and grant hotels infrastructure status will improve amenities and generate jobs in the area.Read more: No test, no stress: 10 countries where your Indian driving license works!The Vibrant Village Programme, which was introduced in 2023 to encourage the development of border communities, was another important focal point of PM Modi's speech.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million.

And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful. The way people of Prayagraj welcomed the pilgrims with open hearts, despite facing inconveniences, was inspirational,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.Creating historyCabinet meeting of Uttar Pradesh government at Prayagraj.120 quintal of rose petals showered on the devotees during the main snan festivals.Prayagraj Airport received its first international flight in 93 years.IAF's spectacular air show on Mahashivratri: Sukhoi, AN-32 and Chetak dominated Sangam skies.Netra Kumbh: Improving vision at Maha KumbhA remarkable highlight of the Maha Kumbh's healthcare efforts was the Netra Kumbh (Eye Fair), an initiative aimed at combating vision impairment. The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

Yes, you read that right. This is the crossover episode nobody saw coming, but everyone needs. Let’s set the stage. Modi and Trump have a bromance that’s tighter than John Cena’s grip on the WWE Championship belt. Remember when Trump visited India in 2020 and Modi pulled out all the stops? We’re talking about a stadium rally with over 100,000 people, a tour of the Taj Mahal, and enough photo ops to break the internet. Trump, never one to shy away from hyperbole, called it “the most incredible welcome” he’d ever received. Fast forward to today, and their friendship is still going strong, with Modi recently meeting Trump during his U.S. visit. These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million.

The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state.

This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore.

Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide. While the Uttar Pradesh government invested Rs 7,500 crore in infrastructural development for Maha Kumbh, it resulted in an unprecedented economic boost of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. Nowhere else in the world has faith been integrated with economic prosperity in such a manner. And while our sages envisioned that honouring faith leads to economic and social progress, Maha Kumbh has brought this vision to reality.The state government had undertaken initiatives to improve police infrastructure and welfare, including increasing the police budget to Rs 40,000 crore, constructing new police barracks, reinstating 54 PAC companies, establishing three all-women battalions, and recruiting over 1.56 lakh police personnel, with an additional 60,000 recruitments in progress. During the grand event, the police personnel who had not yet taken a dip at Sangam were encouraged to carry the sacred water home as a symbol of their service.""Under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, 'Maha Yagya of Unity, Equality, and Harmony' Maha Kumbh 2025, Prayagraj, has been accomplished with unprecedented magnificence. This grand festival of faith and humanity has delivered a powerful message of 'all people are one' to the world, reinforcing the eternal spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,"" UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath said.Guinness World RecordGuinness World Record created for the largest synchronised sweeping drive during Maha Kumbh 2025, in Prayagraj.World record by mass sweeping15,000 sanitation workers set a new world record by mass sweeping for 10 km across four zones.Cleaning of Sangam and ghats329 sanitation workers carried out a coordinated river-cleaning drive at Sangam and ghats of Prayagraj.Longest handprint painting10,102 youths achieved a milestone by continuously carrying out longest handprint painting.

These two are like The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, opposites, but somehow magic when they’re in the same ring.Could Narendra Modi and Donald Trump’s Political Ties Secretly Be Opening Doors for Indian Wrestlers in WWE?Now, here’s where it gets juicy. WWE has been eyeing India as a massive market for years. With over a billion people and a fanbase that treats wrestling like a religion, India is a goldmine waiting to be tapped. But here’s the problem: while WWE has had a few Indian stars like The Great Khali and Jinder Mahal, they’ve never fully capitalized on the country’s wrestling talent. Enter Modi and Trump. What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it. Modi, with his massive social media following and influence, could pitch Indian wrestlers to WWE execs. Trump, a WWE Hall of Famer (yes, really), could use his insider connections to make it happen. Together, they could be the ultimate tag team, helping Indian athletes leap from the mat to the main event. Imagine a WrestleMania in Mumbai, with Modi and Trump sitting ringside, cheering on India’s next big wrestling superstar. It’s not just a dream, it’s a possibility. So, will Modi and Trump become the ultimate power brokers for Indian wrestling? Only time will tell.","What if their political clout could help Indian wrestlers get a shot at WWE stardom?ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Charlotte Hornets Game Preview (03/07): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and MoreThink about it.

(right) Artistes take centre stage NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday said Sufism, with values of love, peace and spirituality integral to it, could serve as a beacon for humanity at a time when the world was threatened by conflicts. ""In today's world, where war is causing immense suffering to humanity, this message of unity and peace becomes even more relevant,"" he said. The PM was speaking at the 25th edition of Jahan-e-Khusrau, the annual Sufi music festival, at Sunder Nursery where he delivered a message of unity, love and cultural harmony.Modi highlighted the deep connection between Indian culture and Sufi traditions, underscoring that India's spiritual and artistic heritage has always been rooted in inclusivity and shared wisdom and recalled the contributions of Amir Khusrau, the revered poet and Sufi mystic, who saw India as a paradise where diverse traditions flourished in harmony.Quoting Khusrau, he said, ""Our Hindustan is that garden of heaven where every shade of culture blossoms."" He added: ""Sufi saints did not confine themselves to mosques and shrines alone. They recited the Quran, listened to the Vedas, and understood the wisdom of the Upanishads."" He emphasised that Sanskrit, as the ancient language of knowledge, played a crucial role in shaping India's philosophical and spiritual landscape, connecting deeply with Sufi thought.Modi also reflected on the unifying power of music, describing how Indian and Sufi music had blended seamlessly to create expressions of devotion and love. He cited Khusrau's words. ""Indian music has such a hypnotic charm that even deer in the forest forget their fears and stand still, mesmerised."" He emphasised that Sufi music was not just an artistic tradition but a means to transcend human differences and connect with the divine.Reinforcing the importance of India's cultural legacy, Modi spoke of the contributions of various poets and philosophers who enriched the spiritual fabric of the nation. He mentioned Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan and Kabir, all of whom, despite their diverse religious backgrounds, echoed a common theme — love as the highest spiritual pursuit. ""Whether we listen to Surdas, Rahim, Raskhan or Amir Khusrau, we ultimately reach the same point — the peak of spiritual love, where human limitations dissolve, and a union between man and the divine is felt,"" he said.Modi drew upon the words of Rumi, the Persian Sufi poet, to illustrate the power of gentle wisdom over aggression. Quoting Rumi, he said, ""Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder."" He emphasised that the philosophy of love and peace propagated by Sufi saints was crucial in today's turbulent times, serving as an antidote to conflict and division.Modi said the timeless values of Sufism aligned with India's spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam — ‘the world is one family'. He urged people to carry forward the message of love and unity, ensuring that cultural traditions continue to bridge divides and foster global harmony.

Speaking at an event in Uttarkashi, he outlined a “360-degree approach to tourism,” which he believes will provide continuous employment for the local youth and unlock the state’s full economic potential.As of now, Uttarakhand's tourism industry is very seasonal, which reaches its high from March to June before plummeting during the winter. Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation. PM Modi proposed creative ways to combat this, like encouraging ""Gham Tapo Tourism"" (Basking in the Sun Tourism) to draw tourists looking for winter sun. He also urged the business community to have retreats and conferences in the area during the off-season.Read more: World’s 6 most useless landmarks (but we love them anyway!)PM Modi discussed important projects including the Char Dham all-weather road, contemporary motorways, and increased air and rail connectivity while highlighting infrastructure advancements. He also brought up the recently approved Kedarnath and Hemkund Sahib ropeway projects, which will cost a total of INR 6,811 crore and be finished in four to six years. It is anticipated that the Kedarnath ropeway alone will drastically improve accessibility for pilgrims and tourists by cutting the trip time from eight to nine hours to only thirty minutes.Uttarakhand's tourism industry has grown rapidly in recent years. Prior to 2014, the Char Dham Yatra drew 1.8 million pilgrims annually; however, PM Modi noted that the number has since increased to around 5 million.

There was also discussion of government-sponsored homestay programs under the Mudra Yojana and the relocation of Nelong and Jadung villages as means of increasing local revenue.PM Modi flagged off a trek and bike rally from Harsil to the remote village of Jadung, aiming to integrate border areas into Uttarakhand’s tourism framework. The importance of the Char Dham Yatra as a main source of income was reaffirmed by Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, who also expressed hope that winter tourism would be recognised under PM Modi's vision, promoting job creation, cultural preservation, and economic progress in the state.","Many hotels, resorts, and homestays mostly remain empty during winters, which also causes economic stagnation.

During this event, the UP government developed five key spiritual corridors aimed at enhancing connectivity to prominent religious sites across the state.Maha Kumbh has revolutionised spiritual tourism in Uttar Pradesh, solidifying the state's reputation as a premier religious destination. To enhance connectivity and accessibility, the UP government has strategically developed five key spiritual corridors, linking prominent religious sites across the state.Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's concept of integrating faith and economy, Yogi Adityanath, CM, UP, opined that spiritual tourism holds immense potential, with UP emerging as the most suitable state to harness it. Last year alone, Uttar Pradesh welcomed 65 crore devotees and tourists to various pilgrimage sites. They visited Ayodhya Dham, Kashi, Mathura-Vrindavan, Prayagraj, Chitrakoot, Maa Vindhyavasini Dham, Gorakhpur, Shukteerth, and Naimisharanya. Prayagraj alone witnessed 66.30 crore tourists and devotees in just 45 days, setting new records.Maha Kumbh has established five major spiritual tourism circuits in the state. Prayagraj has now connected five key spiritual destinations: one from Prayagraj to Mirzapur and Kashi; another to Ayodhya and Gorakhpur; the third to Lalapur, Rajapur, and Chitrakoot, the fourth to Lucknow and Naimisharanya; and the fifth via Bundelkhand Expressway and Agra to Mathura-Vrindavan. Maha Kumbh Mela 2025 Key Moments; '65 Cr' Devotees, Star-Studded Snan, Unique Babas | WatchRepresentatives from 100 countries visited Maha Kumbh during the past 45 days. The entire fair was integrated with facial recognition technology, utilising nearly 3,000 CCTV cameras and Al tools. This enabled real-time tracking of visitors, identifying individuals, and even counting how many people took a holy dip. The double-engine government invested approximately Rs 7,300 crore in the Maha Kumbh for various infrastructure projects. Over 200 roads, 14 flyovers, nine underpasses, and 12 major corridors were developed. To ensure smooth arrangements for devotees, nearly one lakh personnel within Prayagraj city were engaged, who played a key role in making this event a grand success. With an investment of Rs 7,500 crore, Uttar Pradesh government has achieved a growth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore. And while the world watched Maha Kumbh with amazement, it has now become a subject of research.""Crores of people came to the Maha Kumbh with a feeling of devotion. Serving them was also a responsibility that was carried out with the same feeling of devotion. As a Member of Parliament from Uttar Pradesh, I can proudly say that under the leadership of Yogiji, the administration and the people worked together to make this 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' a success. The way 140 crore Indians turned the 'Ekta Ka Maha Kumbh' into a global occasion is truly wonderful.

The event's ambitious target included distributing 3,00,000 eyeglasses and conducting 5,00,000 OPDs, with a daily goal of 10,000 consultations. Covering 10 acres, the Netra Kumbh boasted 11 hangars, where pilgrims underwent systematic eye examinations. After registration, they met doctors in chambers equipped with four specialists and ten optometrists each. The Netra Kumbh initiative is a shining example of the Maha Kumbh's commitment to providing quality healthcare services to those in need.Boatmen felicitated, financial assistance announcedFor millions of Hindu pilgrims at Maha Kumbh, the highlight is bathing in the sacred waters. For generations, boatmen from the Nishad community have helped them reach the holy site, rowing them to the confluence of the rivers. Just as Nishadraj had helped Lord Shri Ram cross the Ganges in Treta Yuga, today's boatmen continue to uphold this tradition.For their undeterred service, CM Yogi Adityanath hailed boatmen for their contribution to the Maha Kumbh and announced several significant welfare measures, including financial assistance for boats and an insurance cover of up to Rs 5 lakh. Uttar Pradesh government extended special benefits to boatmen, beginning with their registration.Commitment to cleanlinessUttar Pradesh created a Guinness World Record as 15,000 sanitation workers joined a synchronised cleanliness drive in Prayagraj during Maha Kumbh 2025, surpassing the 2019 record. Under the guidance of Ganga sevadoots and sector magistrates, 4,000 sanitation workers each participated in the process at Sector-2 helipad, Salori/ Nagvasuki area, Arail and Jhunsi to create the record.UP CM Yogi Adityanath announced an additional bonus of Rs 10,000 for the sanitation and health workers deployed on Maha Kumbh duty as a recognition of their hard work and dedication. He announced that the state govt will soon set up a corporation through which it will provide Rs 16,000 per month to every sanitation worker, health worker and all those workers who were not getting minimum wages. The CM also announced that every sanitation worker, health worker will be linked to health insurance of Rs 5 lakh through Ayushman Bharat or chief minister Jan Arogya Yojana. The workers lauded the CM for honouring them on stage and sharing a meal with them, calling it a gesture of respect. As part of the acknowledgment of their contribution in making the mega event successful, the state government will be taking further steps for the welfare of sanitary and health workers after the Maha Kumbh.Mela cops get recognition, honoured with medals and bonusesA security personnel deployed on Maha Kumbh mela duty were awarded 'Maha Kumbh Seva Medal' along with a certificate of appreciation. Additionally, non-gazetted officers received a special bonus of Rs 10,000, and all personnel were granted a phased one-week leave. The police force at Maha Kumbh received accolades for their patience and discipline, noting that despite challenges like overcrowding and unruly behaviour by some visitors, officers maintained exemplary conduct. The seamless execution of Maha Kumbh was attributed to the collective efforts of the police, security forces, and administration under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The efforts of security agencies, including the Uttar Pradesh Police, paramilitary forces, home guards, PRD, water police, traffic police, NDRF, SDRF, and PAC were highly appreciated. The police force, which once struggled with issues of riots and mafia control, had transformed into a model of 'Mitra Police' (friendly policing), setting a new benchmark worldwide.

Or rather say is giving shoutout to a new catch phrase for xAI's AI chatbot Grok. In a post on Twitter, Elon Musk wrote an affirmative 'Yes' to a post from 'Tesla Owners Silicon Valley' that says: 'Don’t Google it. Grok it.' Grok is positioned it as competitor to OpenAI’s ChatGPT as well as Google Gemini and other AI Chatbots. 'Dumbhead...': Trump Aide 'Gets Ripped Apart' In US House After 'Parasite Class' Post | WatchNot just this, the account shares a series of post on Grok, and the reasons one should be using them. ""Grok 3 images are insanely real 🤯🤯,"" goes one. There are also other post that tell: 'How to download and install Grok?', 'How to use Deep Search with Grok AI?'An earlier post shared the meaning of the word Grok, quoting Elon Musk. ""Grok is a word from a Heinlein novel, Stranger in a Strange Land, and it's used by a guy who's raised on Mars.""For those unaware, Elon Musk founded xAI in 2023 as a counter to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Musk has openly criticized the OpenAI's shift toward a for-profit structure. Elon Musk has filed two lawsuits against OpenAI, alleging it has deviated from its original mission. His involvement with OpenAI dates back to its inception, though he parted ways with its board in 2018. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman dismissed Musk’s buyout attempt as a ploy to hinder their progress.Elon Musk also spoke about the Grok app in his recent podcast with the Youtuber Joe Rogan. The duo used 'Grok Unhinged Mode' In the podcast, Elon Musk asks: ""what is there in Fort Knox?"" They follow with another similar question: ""Do you think all the Gold is there in Fort Knox?"" In answer, the AI chatbot is seen kinda evading the sensitive question. As to those unaware what Fort Knox is? Fort Knox is the most famous repository for Gold in the US. Other than Fort Know, vast quantities of Gold are also reported to be held at mints in West Point, Denver and at the Federal Reserve vault in New York.Coming to the latest on Grok, Elon Musk's xAI recently unveiled an enhanced version of its Grok-3 chatbot. This launch comes shortly after OpenAI rejected Elon Musk's $97.4 billion offer to acquire its nonprofit division.

The controversy arose after Musk was seen making a gesture during President Donald Trump’s inauguration celebration in January, which some critics interpreted as a fascist salute. The incident has sparked widespread debate, with Jewish organizations, politicians, and advocacy groups calling for clarification.In a recent three-hour appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience, Musk addressed the backlash, stating that the gesture was not intended as a Nazi salute and expressing frustration over the growing criticisms. He also spoke about the toll of online hate, claiming that there are active discussions on social media platforms about harming him. While some groups condemned his actions, others, including the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), defended Musk, arguing that the gesture was taken out of context.The controversy has been further fueled by Musk’s previous comments and his political affiliations, particularly his perceived support for Germany’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The debate continues to draw widespread attention, with many questioning Musk’s stance on extremism.Elon Musk dismisses Nazi allegations, says critics ‘want to kill me’During Trump's inauguration celebration in January, Musk was seen making a diagonal arm movement while addressing the crowd. The gesture immediately caught the attention of political figures and advocacy groups, with some interpreting it as a version of the Nazi salute.Michel Friedman, former vice president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, called Musk’s actions a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was a clear ""Heil Hitler"" salute. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler also condemned the gesture, and the Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Musk to clarify his intent.Amid the criticism, Musk-owned X (formerly Twitter) was flooded with accusations, with some users labeling the billionaire a Nazi sympathizer. The ADL, however, took a more neutral stance, suggesting that Musk’s gesture was likely ""an awkward moment of enthusiasm rather than a deliberate Nazi salute.""Elon Musk responds with humour and denialFollowing the backlash, Musk took to X to refute the allegations, responding with a series of puns referencing Nazi leaders, including phrases like ""Don't say Hess to Nazi accusations!"" and ""Bet you did nazi that coming."" While some found the remarks humorous, others criticized him for making light of the situation.During his interview with Joe Rogan, Musk reiterated his denial, stating:""Hopefully people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi.""He went on to argue that the term ""Nazi"" should only be applied to individuals engaging in actions like genocide or war.""What’s relevant about Nazis is, like, are you invading Poland? And if you’re not invading Poland, maybe you’re not a Nazi,"" Musk remarked.He added, ""You have to be committing genocide and starting wars. What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.""Musk also expressed frustration over the relentless criticism he receives, stating, ""Now I can never point at things diagonally.""Musk discusses online hate and death threatsDuring the interview, Musk revealed that the backlash has taken a personal toll, describing it as ""pretty stressful."" He claimed that some online communities actively discuss harming him, saying:""They actually want to kill me. They say so online. There are Reddit forums where they don’t just want to kill me, they want to desecrate my corpse.""The billionaire has faced multiple controversies in recent years, ranging from his political endorsements to allegations of promoting misinformation on X. Musk’s leadership of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a newly formed agency under Trump, has further intensified scrutiny, with critics accusing him of using his government position for personal and political influence.Political controversy and far-right allegationsMusk’s remarks about Nazis are not the only reason his critics have accused him of having far-right sympathies. The CEO has faced backlash for showing support for Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, a nationalist and anti-immigration group.AfD leaders have been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes, with one member referring to the Holocaust as a mere ""speck of bird poop"" in Germany’s history. The party has also been known to repurpose Nazi slogans and advocate for policies that critics say are reminiscent of Germany’s dark past.Although Musk has not officially endorsed AfD, his interactions with far-right figures and his vocal criticisms of progressive policies have led many to question his political leanings.Ongoing debate and public reactionThe controversy surrounding Musk’s alleged Nazi salute and his political views has sparked fierce debate across social media and news platforms. While some argue that Musk is being unfairly targeted, others believe his actions and statements warrant scrutiny.Musk has not issued an official statement beyond his remarks on X and Rogan’s podcast. However, as the conversation continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the backlash will impact his businesses or political standing.For now, the billionaire appears to be standing his ground, dismissing the accusations while expressing frustration over what he perceives as unwarranted hostility. Whether this controversy will fade or escalate further will likely depend on Musk’s future actions and public responses.Also read | Airtel recharge plans | Jio recharge plans | BSNL recharge plans","What is actually bad about Nazis—it wasn’t their fashion or mannerisms, it was the war and genocide.

Ashley's version of the storyAshley made the claim on social media and said she had to do this because tabloid media already got to know that Elon Musk is the father of her child. Then she sued Elon Musk seeking sole custody of the child. In her lawsuit, she attached screenshots of her chats with someone whose name she saved on her phone as 'EM'.

Elon Musk has often warned about declining populations in several Asian countries, including Japan, Singapore and South Korea. Elon Musk even went on to say that Singapore is particularly at risk due to its falling birth rate and is almost on the verge of extinction. In a warning post some time back, Elon Musk wrote, “Singapore will go extinct in some time.” Elon Musk has expressed similar concern about South Korea and Japan.Zoho CEO Vembu in a post on Twitter said that the '996' culture strogly getting popular in China simply mean ever sinking birth rates. ""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment. Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates,"" wrote Vembu.In another post, Vembu made a similar observation about San Fancisco. He wrote, how he did not see children playing in parks in and around SF bay area. ""I visited the SF bay area this week, staying near the Apple HQ, an area of beautiful multi-million dollar homes, well maintained parks - but hardly any young children roaming the wide open residential streets (hardly any traffic) or playing in the parks. It felt empty, particularly going from my Tenkasi village,"" wrote Vembu.

Lacking domestic income to consume their production, they are driven to seek export markets just to keep their operations alive. This is unwise - the ""produce and export at all costs"" and the ""996"" culture simply mean ever sinking birth rates.Japan suffered from this same problem in the 1980s and 90s. What appeared to the outside world as ""Japanese brands everywhere"" really was about ""too many companies, funded with cheap loans, desperately fighting it out in the global market"". In one sense Japan never really recovered, their companies lost their drive as their workforce aged (decades of ultra low birth rates do that to you) and then Korea/China took over from them. Japan achieved ""Karoshi"" - death due to overwork - on a civilizational scale.As an aside, we have seen that in silicon valley too - for example in Saas business and now in AI. Unlike in Japan and China, where bank and government backed loans dominated the investment, in silicon valley it was VC and PE. Over-investment leads to too many companies chasing too few customers. Marketing spending goes through the roof and there is no real profit (you do get ""profit when we don't count the expenses we push to shareholders"" stuff).Globalization of the past 40 years has been driven by infinitely stretchable balance sheets at every level but the imbalances have reached such an extreme that they can no longer be ignored. These trade wars didn't happen out of the blue.What is the alternative?We have to embrace economic balance - production and consumption balanced regionally, which means production balanced by real income to consume the production regionally.We have to question the entire premise of this era of massive imbalances-led globalization. We need fresh thinking.","""As Prof Pettis explains, the Chinese private sector suffers from ""neijuan"" - extreme predatory competition driven by and driving over-investment.

No one. Nor are these funding resumption actions due to pressure from K-Mart (I’m not promoting him to Target yet) Favs or some legacy news journalist. I give zero fucks what the legacy press says and have made that abundantly clear. There are two parts to resuming funding:1. Releasing the pause on the contracts. That was done ~2 weeks ago regarding Ebola/diseases and foodstuffs, which were part of a large block of paused contracts. What I said at the cabinet meeting was accurate. 2. The money itself getting processed through various State, Treasury and Fed accounts and then ultimately getting to the recipient’s bank account.
